Perfumes,Help Identifying Plz - Perfume?/Cologne? was pronounced ‚ÄúGras-E-Ago‚Äù??,"I am attempting to identify and then locate, a perfume that I found mentioned in a passing random video‚Ä¶ 

The individual pronounced the perfume/cologne as ‚ÄúGras-e-ago‚Äù

I have attempted multiple Google Searches with various spellings, Half typed entries in hoping Google would fill in the blank, etc‚Ä¶All to no avail.

So, I decided that Reddit in its infinite wisdom &amp; User Forums (Y‚Äôall!üòâüëçüèª), might be of more help, since it is a topic which each of You are obviously passion about &amp; much more familiar with than myself.

I unfortunately do not have any more information other than the way the person (a female) pronounced the name, when speaking about the fragrance she wore, and received positive comments about when wearing. It was a random video I can not relocate, so I am unable to contact that person directly and ask which fragrance it was she referred to in her video.
I apologize in advance for being so vague, but I have no other information to go on to give you.

Any assistance or constructive suggestions are welcome.

Thank You ALL in advance for Your time, help, and Your even Reading my post!

Perfumes,DS and Durga - I Don‚Äôt Know What Review,"I recently got my hands on a sample of DS and Durga‚Äôs I Don‚Äôt Know What fragrance enhancer and it is blowing my mind. The main ‚Äúnotes‚Äù are iso e super, ambrox super, and a top note of bergamot. I would swim in this stuff if I could afford it (50 mL is $190) but luckily I only need one spray per day - it has insane longevity and moderate sillage. 

Their website describes it as ‚ÄúIt is like a building with only structure‚Äîno interior. You can fill in the interior with an oil, a scent you like, even an old scent that has lost its way. IDKW is built to layer and enhance everything else it touches.‚Äù

And the site goes on to describe iso e super as ‚ÄúWarm and ambery like patchouli with all trace of its aromatic profile sucked out‚Äù, which is exactly what I am getting. It is so fun and sexy and mysterious - very unisex but not particularly femme or masc. I love the general experience of patchouli but have always found it too cloying to wear due to the intensely identifiable aroma and hippie association (lol). I would wear I Don‚Äôt Know What on its own as an everyday scent if I had the full bottle.

I layered it on top of DS and Durga‚Äôs Rose Atlantic and it made the perfume explode in such a beautiful way. Typically Rose Atlantic has very weak longevity on me, but I can smell it many hours later with I Don‚Äôt Know What on top. Rose Atlantic is much more subtle, a waxy sea salt rose scent. A gorgeous modern rose scent if you‚Äôre looking for one.

What perfumes have you come across that are specifically for layering? Have you enjoyed them?",2022-07-28 08:54:33
Perfumes,The most unexpected compliment.,"Today I got into the elevator during my lunch break &amp; I saw a 10/10 getting in the lift with me. I knew straight off that she is way out of my league so i decided not to make a move.

I was walking away from the lift as we got down, Suddenly heard the sound of a pair of heels trotting towards me really fast. She was like 

‚Äú Excuse me Hi I‚Äôm ___ , we were in the lift together and your perfume literally made me go crazy. I feel like it just tapped into my animal instinct, what is it your wearing? ‚Äú

I did NOT expect that! Because the way she spoke to me, She was acting like she was hungry for me. I did tell her the name of the perfume and we exchanged numbers. 

After all this happened I was like ‚ÄúWoah!‚Äù What did I just hear. She literally made my day,

I know this scent not for everyone plus I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a modern day fragrance. But I feel like the ‚ÄúChanel Egoiste‚Äù is a mysterious masterpiece.

Perfumes,#SOTD Arsenico by V Canto,,2022-07-28 18:32:19
Perfumes,#SOTD Arsenico by V Canto,"Arsenico is a beautiful unisex fragrance which includes some interesting notes that are working amazingly good together and surprised me in a good way.

Top notes- calabrian bergamot, red currant, apple and pineapple.  
Middle notes- red patchouli, birch, jasmine, tonka bean, benzoin, cedar and artemisia  
Base notes- amber grey, moss and musk

This beautiful creation opens up with a graceful citrusy bouquet which is guided by calabrian bergamot and slowly becomes sweet thanks to the red fruits. All of this beauty flows to a woody vibe with some red patchouli, cedar and tonka bean which are all emraced by the jasmine and benzoin. This fragrance, with its incredible persistent trail is so long lasting because its true strength is found in grey amber, blended with ancient musk and precious mosses.  
Lovely!!! 

I tried it a few years ago and didn't feel it was right for me. But today, after I grew up a bit, I feel like I now realize what I have been missing. It's such a gorgeous fragrance, so mature and so elegant. Today I know that sometimes we need to give the fragrances the time they need :)",2022-07-28 18:34:04

Perfumes,Looking for something inexpensive that will make me smell like straight up coconut,"I love the smell of coconuts. I absolutely despise the taste and texture of them, but for some reason it‚Äôs probably my favorite smell on the planet. I love smelling like coconut, but purely coconut smelling fragrances are oddly hard to come by. I‚Äôve found plenty of things with notes of coconut, but it‚Äôs always either extremely faint or overpowered by something else, like vanilla or some kind of fruit or god forbid that awful artificial ‚Äúbeach wind‚Äù smell that lights my nostrils on fire. I‚Äôm autistic and have pretty severe sensory processing disorder so I tend to be ridiculously sensitive to smells, so anything unpleasant or sharp mixed into the coconut smell kinda ruins it for me, and I also have an aversion to feeling greasy or oily so straight up coconut oil doesn‚Äôt work either. Is there any generally inexpensive product (like &lt;$30, it doesn‚Äôt need to be anything fancy), be it perfume, cologne, body wash, body spray, conditioner, etc. that just smells like coconut and smells strongly of it too?

Good Chemistry Wild Child. (Discontinued. ADORE the most sensual and mature UNISEX coconut)

Zara Fields @Nightfall . smoky sweet and very decent dupe.

Clean Reserve Radiant Nectar . Trashy syrupy floral . Aggressively feminine .

Kvd Sinner. Again . Trashy . Powdery goth whore . 

Ariana Grande cloud . People say it‚Äôs a dupe for baccarat whatever . I wouldn‚Äôt know because I‚Äôm a cheap whore but I love this . It‚Äôs warm and sweet but not syrupy . Very enticing and the lasting and projection is amazing for about $20. Love

Moschino boy toy. Love /hate with this one . A very unique rose jam but also gothic . I wanna say it smells like ivy but I‚Äôve never smelled ivy but i feel like poison ivy wearing this . 

Korres Vanilla Freesia. Yes . Love vanilla so this is biased but everything else worked the litchi in the opening. The warmth of the patchouli &amp; musk. I get a vanilla version of jimmy choo on here which is another favorite . Absolutely adore this and layer it with Victoria secret bare vanilla lotion because I‚Äôm a cheap ass whore .",2022-07-30 15:09:52

Perfumes,Help me choose between these two PdM scents: La Rosee or Meloria?,"Recently ordered one of their discovery sets and they offer a $50 off coupon for any full bottle from their website, which expires soon for me. I would say out of all of the Delinas, I much prefer La Rosee, with the OG Delina coming in at a close second but not quite FBW to me. I actually found Delina Exclusiv to be repulsive, I guess it may be the amber note that's more prominent in the dry down since  I generally do not like anything with an amber note.  I like Meloria a lot but I've heard that there's a cheaper 'dupe' so, I'm on the fence about getting a full bottle of it. 

Unsure why Meloria retails for slightly more on PdM's website for the same size bottle, it actually has slightly worse longevity on my skin compared to La Rosee.

It smells wonderful on my skin, but I feel that no one can smell it unless they‚Äôre sniffing my arm or neck (and well, that‚Äôs a little too close for most people). Ha! 

I‚Äôve been searching for a signature perfume that smells the same but gives a more moderate sillage. There are tons of Amber options out there, but a lot I‚Äôve tried smell too powdery. Powdery florals smell too mature to me, like an elderly woman‚Äôs fragrance so I avoid those.

Perfumes,Anyone ever experience this issue?," 

I'm new to the world of perfumery and looking for a bit of advice.

I'm using two essential oils and one fragrance oil and am close to finding the perfect balance of the three for the smell I want.

I'm using perfumer's alcohol from Vetiver. I follow the 80/20 ratio and filling 10ml bottles with 8ml of alcohol and 2ml of oils.

40% top note, 50% middle note, 10% base note.

Here's the issue I'm experiencing and don't think it's normal.

When I attempt so spray the bottle, I have to put a lot of pressure on the top when pushing down. I feel like it shouldn't take so much, and I did something wrong. My alcohol supplier states on the site that adding water isn't necessary with the product I'm using.

I don't have any issues with the bottles before adding the perfume. What are you guys' thoughts?

Edit: Please if my alcohol to oil ratios are off let me know. Using 12 drops for top note, 20 drops for mid and 8 drops for base. That's the 2ml with 8ml alcohol for my 10ml bottles.",2022-08-03 18:25:48

My issue is, I'm looking back in my order history and the TF perfume has been changed, so I think the other sample was to (since the app is recognizing the offer rather than the specific listing).

Does anyone know which sample it could have been? Searching the app for ""sandalwood"" is popping up the NEST New York fragrance. Was that a sample in June?",2022-08-05 06:12:54

I am new to perfumes and looking for a signature scent that is light enough that I can wear to the office and not exude scent. I really loved Marc Jacobs Dot but that's discontinued now. Something similar would be nice but if not I quite like the light floral. Too much and I feel like I smell like a grandma. 

If raspberry/red berries is too hard to come by, I also love mango and gardenia. 

I would rather it be more inexpensive, and indie scents are fine as well. If you can get them at Sephora even better because I can hopefully sample a few! 

Thanks all :)",2022-08-06 01:02:40

I am 19 years old and starting at University this fall. I'm looking to buy a new fragrance for fall/winter (should go in the direction of sweet).  
I already own LNDL, YSL Y and Lacoste Blanc.

The three fragrances I am considering:

La Nuit de L'Homme Bleu √âlectrique  
Le M√¢le Le Parfum  
Sauvage Elixir

I really like LNDL so the Bleu √âlectrique sounds like a good idea. But googling i also come across the other two.

Perfumes,Fragrance Minimalism- How Many Perfumes do You Really Need?,"Whether you‚Äôre a dude or dudette who loves fragrances but prefers not to get engulfed by rampant consumeristic practices, it is good to know that you only need a few bottles in your rotation. So how many do you really need? My magic number is 3.

**The All-Arounder**

This type of fragrance can be worn in multiple (if not all) situations, places, and weather conditions. My personal preference for an all-arounder usually falls under the fresh or fresh spicy category. The fragrance is inoffensive, likable, and easy to wear. You may or may not receive compliments while wearing it but you know you won‚Äôt choke out people either if you find yourself in enclosed spaces such as elevators, trains, and cramped conference rooms.

Suggestions: Tonic for Men/ Eau de Vie for women

**The Show-Stopper**

Among other things, fragrances are meant to give a person a strong sense of self and project self-confidence. Show-stoppers are incredibly memorable scents that set you apart from the crowd. You‚Äôd do well with choosing unique accords or notes that are less mainstream. This would mean your fragrance may not be as mass-appealing as your all-arounder, so you can expect people to either absolutely hate it or love it.

Suggestions: Priv√© Portrait of a Gentleman/Priv√© Amore Silenzioso (unisex)/Saffron Haze/Oui Mademoiselle

**The Skin Scent**

Okay, hear me out. Although seemingly counterintuitive, having a skin-scent type of fragrance in your small rotation is actually a useful option to have. Certain fragrances are designed to specifically enhance your natural smell. The concept of ‚ÄúYou-but-better‚Äù scents can work well, provided that the perfumer can execute the formulation well and use the right notes that can actually enhance a person‚Äôs unique personal aroma.

Suggestion: Nude Extrait de Parfum

Fragrance minimalism does not have to take away from your love of scents. In fact, it allows you to have a more intimate olfactory experience the way you never have before due to having too many fragrances in your collection.",2022-06-25 17:18:04

Perfumes,Abbott NYC- Please Read,"I fell in love with Cape and have been slowly trying out other scents. I have ordered from Sephora bc of points and their return policy. However Sephora does not have one scent I wanted to try so I ordered a new scent directly from the Abbott website and a small size of the scent Sephora does not carry. All arrived and the scent Voyageurs which I ordered in the small size had a very odd scent, it dries down to smell like fuel, an almost gasoline scent. 

I wrote Abbott per their refund policy stating such and I'd like to return it for a refund. The owner (?) Michael Pass emailed me back and said they could only refund me 50%. Website says full refund for defective product so I push back. He emails me back in an unhinged manor and makes claims I'm a conspiracy theorist and snarkily adds I've insulted their perfumes. What in the world?

In my email I highly complimented their perfumes and raved about the other scents I have and said I loved the other scent I received but Voyageurs dried down in a very unpleasant fuel-smelling way. 

They did refund me, but Michael Pass and his insane customer service has put me off Abbott forever. There was more malarkey to the entire story but I don't have proof of it so I won't go in to it.

Lastly, just a heads up. The company is branded as Abbott NYC but they're based out of Texas now. A lot of people learned why bussinesses move to TX after Elon Musk moved Tesla as he wasn't able to legally exploit his workforce in California.",2022-06-25 21:38:04

Perfumes,REPOST: Looking for a dupe for the (2004) formulation of Britney Spears Curious.,"I used to love Curious by Britney Spears when it was released in 2004 but never bought it. I have it now (plus layering with the matching lotion) and it's good, but definitely not as complex or deep as the original. 
It hardly seems to last either.

A kind person recommended Ralf Lauren Blue Women as a dupe, but it's discontinued.

Can anyone recommend something with the same scent, depth and lasting power of the original, that I can test in stores before I buy?

Many thanks!",2022-06-26 06:06:07

Angel is the only perfume that smells different from all the rest in the fragrance shop and i need some reccomendations for someone who loves unique smells!

My problem with Angel is that i sometimes get tired with this scent as it sticks out too much. So i have been wanting to find a unique scent that is casual and fruity/floral. Olympea Legend has caught my eye so far but i have not smelled it yet. 

Nowadays i just rotate between Light Blue and Angel as they are my favorites and i wear Light Blue when i need a break from Angel. But now i need a break from both of them and i realised that i do not own a unique fruity or floral perfume yet or found any that i like because i despise floral. But i really do want to like it.

Do you have any designer perfume reccomendations based on this info?",2022-06-27 18:45:43

I can't find a photo of the bottle and I don't remember the name (so helpful, I know).

I remember it was a clear glass bottle, almost the size of a wine bottle. Similar in shape but had a flat top and some type of cork like cap. The perfume itself was clear or basically clear with no color. I specifically remember a white label with calla lillies on it. 

For reference. We're in the US.  I remember her having it in the late 90s and/or early 2000s. She definitely no longer had it past 2008 or so. 

I remember sniffing it all the time and stealing dabs of it from her. It may have been discontinued. It could've also been a wedding present and if that's the case, it may be from the mid to late 80s.  My mom no longer remembers it so the wedding idea is just that.

Perfumes,My budget scent finds,"I was just mentioning on here about a budget perfume that I am in love with. I have to add a couple to it:

1. Fancy (Jessica Simpson). It smells more ""grown-up"" than I expected &amp; it wears differently depending on the weather. It does well on me in the hot/humid summer weather. Fragrance is s said to be composed of sweet/fruity/caramel/vanilla/powdery/almond/white floral/fresh/nutty/amber. I get Caramel/Vanilla/Powder/Floral. 
2. Fantasy Intimate (Britney Spears). I don't know how these young gals are doing it but they are doing it well! This one is weirdly good one day and just nice the next. When it's good, it is not as flattering on me as Fancy but it's ""grown-up"" and  I get more of the musky and ozonic from the supposed accords of vanilla/sweet/musky/powdery/ozonic/citrus/fresh/fruity/white floral/amber
3. Egyptian Goddess (Auric Blends). It's an oil and it works better for me with fresh-from-the-shower skin or at bedtime. It's hard to describe but it's SO nice. It has all the ""main accords"" of powdery/musky/floral and is super soft, depending on how and where you apply it. If I apply just a bit to my wrists and throat, it's quiet and soft. If I want stronger projection, I also apply it to my bosom and right at the outside of my armpits. I only get the vanilla and musk with just enough floral to make the musk more feminine. This oil is a better one on me than the Kuumba Made Amber Paste that I like so much.

Now, realize that these will probably smell nicer and last longer on younger skin. I am 61 and no longer have the body great chemistry for fragrances. They tend to fade faster and not project as well as when I was under 50. (My mama did NOT tell me this about aging!)

The Fanny and Fantasy scents cost me under $20 each. Goddess was around $12.  I think that I sometimes get caught up in thinking price = better. I spent $30 on a small roller of The Only One and... it's a dud on me. It works really well, thank goodness if I layer it with the Egyptian Goddess or even Kuumba Made's Amber Paste. 

I also have turned my nose up at some celebrity scents but no longer. I have already asked for (and am waiting to receive) a bottle of Mariah Carey's Dreams, which sounds like it has my favorite notes in it.

 I also like the  Vanilla Bourbon from Mix:Bar but the perfume is no stronger or longer-lasting than the cheaper body mist. And their Cloud Musk is *such* a dupe for Glossier's You that I am stunned. Of course, it's not as long-lasting but, for the price, I'd rather keep re-applying Cloud Musk as often as needed. In my opinion, the perfume of Cloud Musk is better than the mist but I get a nicer boost from using both. I do the mist on my hair and clothes while I use the perfume on my skin.",2022-07-05 01:17:14

Perfumes,"Help Identify this Scent, Please!","Hello! I'm kinda new to this sub but and figured that this was the best place to turn to.

A little context: Not sure if I'm allergic to it, but ever since I was little I noticed that there was this distinct smell that was only worn by women 50+ older (like fellow church-goers or relatives. Never got to ask-didn't think to at the time). Didn't effect me so much then, but now if I smell it on strangers I get throbbing headaches. I know y'all can't diagnose anything thru that, and I wouldn't ask you to, but I'm insanely curious as to what scent these women are wearing. At the very least, I'll have a better idea of what's going on/have a name for that darned smell. 

Last time I caught a whiff, it smelled like some herbs and spices, and maybe a hint of weed? It really just screamed ""incense"" to me, like some old-timey scent. If it's an actual perfume, it has to be something from the US or a cheap import that is from the 60s(70s?). Anything I researched myself didn't look to be it. Also, I bring up age because a relative once told me it could be a product you use at an elderly age to mask sweat or other? Sounds weird, I know, but if it rings a bell, then I'd love to hear your thoughts. 

If it's not, the best guess I have is some type of herbal oil or natural scent? When I tried to research on individual herbs/aromas for aromatherapy, and frankincense sounded like the closest to it by description. But, I'm a dumb-dumb when it comes to things like that, and don't have the means to test that theory. 

I hope this helps. I'll try to answer as best I can if y'all have anymore questions. And thank you so much in advance for taking the time to help/read!",2022-07-08 00:17:21

Notes I smell in cloud:

* Cream
* Musk? (It smells very warm and soft)

As such, my backyard then was pretty much the Caribbean, and my front yard was basically the Bahamas. I wound up falling in love with a perfume called 'Guanahani' that I found in Freeport, GBI. 

Well, now being in Chicago I don't get to the Bahamas as often - the last time I did I bought several bottle sof Guanahani, but now I've run out - and they claim they're no longer able to ship to the US due to American Customs. This is their link (NOT Spam), in case you want to check it out: [https://www.perfumefactory.com/fragrance/guanahani-ladies/](https://www.perfumefactory.com/fragrance/guanahani-ladies/)

Their website describes Guanahani as: ""A sweet fresh floral ‚Äì jasmine, gardenia, tuberose, mandarin, ylang ylang, patchouli and nutmeg"". I have no idea if the way these ingredients are listed reflects the amount of each in the fragrance, or if it's just random. IMHO Guanahani is a very, very unique scent - I have not smelled anything else like it... And that's the problem.

I'm currently looking for a fun fragrance that I can use for work, preferably something that can last a while with decent projection. Since it's just for work, I'm fine with cheaper perfumes.

I've been looking through fragrances, and I've been wondering if some of the Britney ones might be right for me.

If I smell like cake or baking, then I'm happy lol.

I haven't smelled the Britney fragrances before, and I'm struggling to know the difference. I've read the different notes, but I'm struggling to gauge if any might be inappropriate for day to day wear.

# 1: How Can I Pick Perfect Perfume For Myself?

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Know Your Scents**

The first few steps to choose your signature scent is to understand what are the notes inside the perfumes. Men's cologne have different categories that describe the ingredients and therefore the scents they create. 

Once you understand the categories you will understand what notes are for you and what you'd rather avoid. Do you like to smell flowery? Aquatic? Woody?

Be sure to consider your personality and style as well as the time of year and the occasion. They matter more than you think.

It sounds a lot of stuff to keep in mind to just smell nice but it‚Äôs worth every second of effort.

&amp;#x200B;

 **2. The Main Scents**

#### Aromatic

Aromatic scents are rich in benzene and notes found in organic matter. Aromatic fragrances commonly have rustic scents with a certain freshness, often coming from herbal notes, and are commonly indicated for men. The most common are rosemary, thyme, mint, tarragon, marjoram, fennel, basil, sage, ansine cumin, and grassy spicy plants.

#### Citrus

Citrus scents are created after hesperidin fruits. Think about Verbena, lemongrass, pomelo, yuzu as well as typical citrus fruits like lemon, orange, grapefruit, and mandarin. One of the most common is Bergamot (The Earl Gray smell). Citrus properties let these oils peak as top notes and sparkle on just about any **blend**.

#### Floral 

The largest group of scents is self-explanatory. These scents add a romantic touch and remove the heaviness of more tenacious ingredients. Some flowers are used in their natural state like rose, jasmine, tuberose, lavender, osmanthus, immortelle, ylang ylang, and marigold while others need to be recreated in labs like freesia, peony, lily of the valley, heliotrope, violet, jonquil, narcissus, hyacinth.

#### Leather

Historically speaking leather is one of the earliest notes used in perfumery. In the past, oils, musk, and ambergris were used to mask the odor of the animal skins. Nowadays these notes are both natural (birch, styrax, cassie, castoreum, myrtle) or recreated in labs (quinolines, safraleine, aldehyde and synthesized suede nuances).

#### Woody

Woody fragrances are dominated by wood scents. They add a sensual touch to the perfumes and empower other scents. This varied and versatile category includes oakmoss, amber, rosewood, guaiac, oud, vetiver, patchouli.

Smokey

Traditionally created with notes of incense, birch tar, tobacco, and various woods, including cedar and cypress, a smoky perfume is your ideal winter-warming fragrance.

#### Aquatic

Aquatic notes in a perfume is not a specific note but more of a fragrance composition that conveys freshness and purity. An aquatic note captures a sensation of the sea, fresh mountain air and freshly washed sheets and can be found in many modern and ""clean"" scents.

&amp;#x200B;

### Why Do The 4 Seasons (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter) Matter In Perfumes?

Much like putting on a sweater during the winter and a sundress in summer, you can think of perfumes as a seasonal part of your routine. You should choose the perfect amount of scent according to the weather outside. Warm weather brings out the best in fragrances. When the weather heats up we can smell so many scents in the air: flowers blooming, fruits ripening, we are bombarded by so many scents! 

Keep this in mind and adjust the amount of perfume you're going to use. Don't be afraid to ""wear"" a fragrance but be aware of its impact because when the temperature heats up the scents will be intensified and it's a good idea to choose a lighter scent. Citrus and floral **accords** are perfect for this time of the year because they project a light, refreshing scent and **blend** well with other scents that occur naturally in the environment.

On the opposite side we have cold weather that is great for perfumes with amber **accord**. When it's cold outside, rich and spicy scents give you a feeling of warmth. Lower temperatures can really lessen the impact of a scent!

Spring and fall are transitional seasons and the weather may change rapidly. Be ready to bring out floral notes during spring and choose warmer scents when summer turns into fall. 

Whether you stick with one signature or many based on your mood or the seasons, always learn how fragrances interact with your body chemistry and the temperature.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2: Why Should I Wear Fragrance/s?

### No One Likes To Smell Bad! 

It is instinctive for people to shun those who smell bad by either talking less with them or physically avoiding them. Think of how many times you have shunned someone just because of their smell?

Perhaps you are looking to expand your social circle or get a date (or two), wearing a fragrance that is suitable for the weather will allow you to smell good and attract more social interactions. Wearing Fragrances in addition to your clothes so as to both look and smell good to other people will surely enhance the social interaction and more compliments are always a good confidence booster! Not to mention, it can be a good ice-breaking conversation starter!

### ‚ÄúPerfume is the art that makes the memory speak.‚Äù - Francis Kurkdjian 

It's not uncommon for a scent to invoke a specific memory, like a magical deja vu moment.. I‚Äôm sure some scents do the same for you!

When you wear a specific fragrance to a special event or if you wear a specific fragrance while creating a memory, you will be in control to an extent. Why not create memories that you can remember when you smell a scent? 

Here is a little story about the funny memory linked to my ‚ÄúSignature Scent‚Äù. While I was doing [‚ÄúPortugal Tour‚Äù](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cc-_I7FrMm_/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY=) I was sleeping in a hostel (which is something I love to do as you meet different people) and I planned to go out. Always before going out I go to a hotspot in the hostel where everyone is gathering. I had so many fragrances in my suitcase because I was delivering the customers that I forgot to bring my fragrances (ironic).

 One of the customers during my flight told he won‚Äôt make it and I should return the scent. 

Since I forgot mine, I decided to use it for myself. Oh boy I was lucky! It was ‚ÄòHint of Vanilla‚Äù. I applied only 1 spray since my skin projects crazy with it (will talk more about it later) and the Brazilian girl in the lobby was immediately hooked up.

 She was sitting the whole night before going out next to me and giving me compliments about the fragrance and how it reminds her of her home.

Let‚Äôs just say, that night was crazy!! Moving on.

**Life is short!! Be in control!!**

&amp;#x200B;

# 3: How Should I Wear Fragrance/s?

### Technique 1, Skin Type 2, Flavored Oils 3!

1. **Always Look To Perfect Your Spraying Technique**

**Find out which part of your body is most reactive to the perfume!** 

Try 3-4 sprays of your desired perfume on each individual pulse point and get a friend to smell you from your desired distance (up to 2 feet away) in order to determine which of your pulse points will project the scent better. **Some pulse points you can try: ‚Ä¶.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ge05qo2fosb91.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b5a600d909c36680c38e987d9888b84b080a3bd

  

**Layer the perfume!**

In order to get the perfumes to last longer, you can layer it. Just spray multiple layers of the perfume on top of your desired pulse point to optimize the **projection**.

**Spray and Layer on multiple pulse points!**

For maximum **projection**, spray 3-4 layers on **multiple** pulse points and you will smell like a champ all day everyday!

**Advanced: Mix up the Layers!**

You can **blend** your own type of fragrance just by layering 2 different types of fragrances on top of each other. For example, if you find that ***Leathery Path*** is too strong for your liking and feel that it needs to be a little sweeter, you can add a few layering sprays of ***American Dream*** on top of it! 

The possibilities are endless! [Share your mix in the Telegram chatroom and let's chat!](https://t.me/+M52nGQh_S4s3Yzhk)

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Remember, Not Every Type Of Perfume Will Stick To Your Skin!**

Everyone has a different skin chemistry, something that might work for someone might not work for you! Keep that in mind and don‚Äôt be too quick to blame the product if it doesn‚Äôt stick!

&amp;#x200B;

**3.Not All Flavored Oils Are Created Equal!**

Every perfume is a mixture of an alcohol base and a **blend** of flavor oils! 

Not all oils are the same, some flavor oils oxidize faster than the others, after oxidizing, they lose their aromatic properties. This is why perfumes smell different in the start and smell different when they enter into the **dry-down** stage. It is important to know that some oils (like citrus) will always oxidize faster than others (like woody and smokey). Always try the perfume on your skin and try to find out which one lasts!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# 4. Are Chez Pierre Perfumes Safe To Use On Skin?!

We at Chez Pierre only source quality ingredients from European and Arabic origins. 

Our perfumes have all the required EU certificates certifying and complying to all Health and Safety standards. 

In addition to that, our source ingredients comply with IFRA standards. The IFRA Standards are rigorously developed by designer fragrance houses and their various downline stakeholders so as to ensure that the consumers can enjoy certified fragrances with confidence without worries.

After all, we are a company registered in Europe (Serbia) and we ship from Serbia so we must comply with all EU regulations.

Because of the rigorous standards that we comply with, Chez Pierre fragrances are absolutely safe for your skin. We even encourage people to spray fragrances on neck and pulse spots and to avoid clothes.

Spraying on the clothes can actually leave stains and to be honest, no one wants that.

As written above we source certified quality ingredients from France and we make the final product in our highly managed production area. Don‚Äôt worry! it‚Äôs not coming from someone‚Äôs basement! Picture below =)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1k86n0zfosb91.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddef20ba2e43fb53e42eb98ae7fd0ba408d67826

&amp;#x200B;

# 5: What Are Ratios and How Do I Pick Them?

A fragrance is usually a mix of a concentrate (containing fragrant oils) and an alcoholic base. Some fragrances can also contain a bit of water and additives like liquid UV filters, stabilizers or colorants. Therefore, fragrances with a higher fragrance concentration contain more **perfume oils** and less alcohol, and vice-versa.

Usually, a higher **perfume oil** concentration means an increased performance of the fragrance (particularly longer-lasting scent) ‚Äì but the impact of oil concentration is much more complex and varies depending on each formula. 

We use a mix of **Eau de Toilette** and pure **perfume oil** to create our ‚Äúratios‚Äù.

This means nothing to you? Yes I know so let‚Äôs keep it simple.

The main difference is the amount of **perfume oil** in the perfumes. 

Here is an example of what most of the industry uses and what you might have seen in stores:

**Eau de Cologne** (EDC) 3% - 10% oils

**Eau de Toilette** (EDT) 5% - 15% oils

**Eau de Parfum** (EDP) 15% - 20% oils

**Parfum** / **Extrait** 20% - 35% oils

**Eau de Parfum** (1:4)  is the most common ratio you will find in stores, it's not too oily and it stays on the skin for 4-8 hours depending on the fragrance, weather, and your skin. This is really important as every skin is different and absorbs fragrance differently. Fragrance cannot be the same on each skin as everybody is different. 2-3 sprays are enough to last thru the day.  
**Extrait de Parfum** (1:2) is a stronger version of the fragrance which contains almost double the amount of pure oil. **Projection** lasts from 4 to 12 hours but again as written above, many factors depend on it. We advise taking this ratio if your skin doesn‚Äôt hold the fragrance great. 1-2 sprays will be enough.

We think personally that EDC and EDT are too weak and therefore we don‚Äôt want to sell it.

We offer fragrances in EDP ratio (1:4) and **Extrait** ratio (1:2)  
The main difference is that we use 20% pure **perfume oil** for **Eau de Parfum** (1:4) and 35% for the **Extrait de Parfum** (1:2).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pxfj05fiosb91.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d92fb9029b8c9be3bec3cc90bbe5ac8d7de2fb5

&amp;#x200B;

# 6: The 100$ Fragrance I Get In-Store Only Costs 2$ To Produce?

The cost to produce a ROLEX watch is actually only $500‚Ä¶ Why are you paying $10,000 for it?! Marketing, Manipulation, and Mania!

### Marketing, Manipulation, and Mania!

Market the product through all social media channels, influencers, physical billboards, and shopping malls! Make sure everyone‚Äôs eyeballs are on it. Put the products on thought leaders like celebrities, influencers, sports stars.

Manipulate by capping or reducing its supply!

Create the Mania and ride the wave!

How much does that fancy $100-a-bottle department store perfume you wear *really* cost to make? You will be surprised that the liquid in it is the cheapest part of the fragrance while everything else drives the price up

If perfumes were priced like sausages, they would cost about the same: roughly $2.50. 

Your butcher will tell you that sausages, just like most consumer goods are priced using the 

cost-plus approach. In other words, you add up the cost of making the product and mark it up to cover your overhead and your profit.

Why am I telling you this? Well in the fragrance world liquid costs only 2$ if you produce it in tones like big brands. Yes, you read it right, only 2$ for 50ml liquid.

Here is a rough table of how much it costs to make a ‚Äú100$ fragrance‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2pib6dyjosb91.png?width=1052&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed1015fe525b16c1dedb46e12fe2d68354938965

We don‚Äôt have the purchasing power of a large designer brand. Hence, we can‚Äôt get volume discounts when buying ingredients. Volume drives the cost per unit down because it forms a bigger base over which the manufacturer can spread their fixed cost.

On the other hand that's why we are here to offer an alternative to people. We cannot produce in large quantities like others but we are here to cut the middleman and other aspects in the cost by offering liquid that we created with our partners in France and by using the most basic bottle that is not expensive to source. 

After all, everything was made by a family business that's been doing it for almost 30 years!

# 7: How Is My Order Made and Do I Need To Mature My Perfumes After Receiving Them?

One thing people don‚Äôt know about us is that every order that you guys make is actually custom-made. 

***How you may ask?*** 

Well, each fragrance is poured down and made once you place the order. The fragrance is ‚Äúfresher‚Äù but it takes more time to dispatch the order.

We do it every day, nothing is pre-made and poured down, we don‚Äôt like doing that.

**Maturation** is a huge topic and it depends on so many things. First of all it depends how long has **fragrance** company held their creations before releasing and when it was mixed.Hot and cold temperature can make changes but so many things can happen during the transport and some **perfumes** can be too much exposed to the sun while transporting.

Chez Pierre's **fragrances** in 99% of the time don't need to **maturate** as we are always pushing them on the side to **maturate** before selling them. 

If you receive a  **fragrance** and you think it needs more time, keep it in a dark place and let it sit for some weeks/months testing them from time to time until the smell appeals to you.

&amp;#x200B;

# 8: Why Does The Perfume Smell Different From The Bottle vs On Paper vs On My Skin?

Imagine you are sitting down in your room with your friends (This never happened to me, I don‚Äôt have friends /s) and one of your friends is sweating more, the other has more pimples, one has softer skin while you have more fat or muscle under their skin. 

Do you think fragrance will stay the same on everybody‚Äôs skin and will project the same? 

**Actually NO!** Like the unique humans we are, we are all different and so is our skin.

Some fragrances project crazy good on one skin and smell wonderful, while on another skin it won‚Äôt smell the same.

This is the sad truth. I was so sad when I tested ‚ÄúBakar‚Äù, It didn‚Äôt smell as how I had imagined it to be on my skin. I gave a fragrance to my friend to try it and it was a completely different story. 

It was projecting 12+ hours and it smelled amazing. 

We have to face it that not every fragrance will fit us.

That's why when you smell the fragrance on the paper, it might not smell the same as on your skin. 

Smelling the fragrance in its liquid form means smelling the oils suspended in alcohol. The oils are unable to oxidize fully while in the alcohol suspension and therefore when smelling it in its liquid form, the fragrance does not smell ‚Äòfull‚Äô. 

This is why shops make you spray it on the tester strip paper as a baseline for smelling a fragrance.

# 9: Learn the words

### Accord

The resulting aroma produced by independent notes interacting with one another.

### Atomizer

The nozzle on a perfume bottle for spraying and applying.

### Body spray

Even lighter than cologne, spritz a body spray all over to add just a touch of fragrance.

### Blend

A term employed when referring to the way aromatic compounds are mixed for a harmonious fragrance.

### Clone Houses

Perfume shops or companies that are only dedicated to producing perfumes that smell like those you can buy in large chain stores, usually at a cheaper price. Chez Pierre is a clone house actually. We make fragrances that smell similar to what you can find in the store but with our own touch.

### Cologne

Cologne is a light, refreshing fragrance that you can splash all over your body. Since it's so light, don't expect it to linger.

### Decant

A popular practice within the online fragrance community. An enthusiast will buy a large bottle of a premium fragrance then sell small 10 ‚Äì 30 ml vials to other members in order to cover costs or make a small profit.

### Designer Fragrances

A designer fragrance is usually a perfume or cologne scent created by famous designer/s whose name on the bottle almost guarantees that many will want to try it.

### Dry-Down

The process of a fragrance cycling through its notes after being applied. It evaporates as it dries, which releases the aromas in a particular order according to their volatility. The overall experience is known as the ‚Äú**dry-down**‚Äù.

### Eau de parfum

This isn't as concentrated as perfume, but it's kind of like a perfume prep. Derived from pure perfume, eau de perfume‚Äôs formula is more concentrated with 15 to 20 pure essence. It lasts for around 4 to 5 hours.

### Eau de toilette

Eau de toilette is a lightly scented fragrance with a lower concentration of fragrant oils than pure perfume.

### Eau Fra√Æche

Literally ‚Äúcool water‚Äù, **eau fra√Æche** was a predominantly feminine accessory until recently. With a concentration similar to aftershave, a spritz is supposed to provide light refreshment. Today, it is often used to label summer flanker releases for fragrances.

### Essential Oil

A concentrated liquid that contains a volatile aroma compound extracted from plants through steam or distillation.

### Extrait de parfum (pure perfume, perfume, parfum, parfum extrait or simply extract)

**Extrait de parfum** (always called pure perfume, perfume, parfum, parfum extrait or simply extract) is the strongest scent available on the market, so it usually comes in tiny bottles and is very expensive. Its high concentration makes it more valuable. Apply perfume to your pulse points.

### Layering

The act of spraying multiple sprays of the same scent ontop of each other with the desire to make it project stronger off your skin.

### Maturation

**Maturation** (always mistaken with **maceration**) is the time required for a perfume concentrate to age or reach its full potential before being put into a base.

### Maceration

**Maceration** is the most commonly used method for removing the essential oils found in certain types of flowers (see ""*Floral*"" section in ""*How can I pick Perfect perfume for myself &gt; The Main Scents*) which are then used in **perfumes** and **fragrances**. This process happens by soaking flowers in warm fats and removing the oil. Once removed, it is then dissolved in alcohol so the extract of the floral oil can be used.

### Niche Fragrances

Niche perfume is perfume made by companies dedicated primarily to creating perfume, as opposed to perfume from fashion houses (often called ""designer perfume"") or famous people (""celebrity scents"").

### Notes

The individual scents used in the oil portion of the perfume. Notes come together to form an ***Accord***.

### Over spray

The act of spraying more than 15++ sprays in multiple layers all round your body so as to maximize longevity, projection and sillage of a fragrance. Often used with weaker fragrances so as to make it last a whole day.

### Perfume oil

Perfume or fragrance oils are the alcohol-free, all-natural types of perfume based on raw fragrant plant-derived ingredients.

### Projection

The way a scent is able to diffuse in the air of the wearer‚Äôs body.

### Pulse Points

Parts of your body where the pulse is readily distinguished at the location. Usually where an artery approaches the surface, making that spot a higher temperature than the rest of the body. The higher temperature heats up the oils when you spray on it and thus increases the projection.

### Reformulate / Reformulations

This became so common in the fragrance world. Usually, after a few years of the release of the fragrance, the house decides that they need more money or IFRA decides to change the regulation of some substance and the house decides to change the formulation of the fragrance.

One of the most famous (and everybody hates it) is YSL La Nuit de L‚Äôhomme reformulation. The

Fragrance before 2014 was one of the most interesting on the market but after reformulation, it‚Äôs not ‚Äòit‚Äô anymore. The sillage and longevity is not the same anymore.

### Signature Scent

Everyone has their own signature scent. It‚Äôs the scent that everyone remembers when you pass by or enter the room. My personal signature scent is ‚ÄúHint of Vanilla‚Äù as it projects so strong on my skin that the neighbor two streets away knows when I put the scent ;)

### Sillage

Sillage in perfume refers to the trail created by a perfume when it is worn on the skin. A fragrance does not need to be a heavy one to have a large sillage. It is not to be confused with its 'projection' (how a fragrance is perceived by others around the wearer) and is enhanced by motion, ambient temperature as well as the inherent qualities of the skin.

Perfumes,What‚Äôs your favourite cheapie perfume you own? Maximum $50,"For me it‚Äôs my $10 bottle of Red Baccara (BR540 Dupe). 
Smells gorgeous and the bottle is beautiful. I can overspray and not feel guilty money wise. Smells so close to the real thing!

Then it‚Äôs my $42 bottle of Roberto Cavalli ‚ÄúParadiso Azzuro‚Äù.
The bottle is a breathtakingly beautiful ombr√© blue, and it smells like a sophisticated &amp; improved version of Cool water.

Last but not least‚Ä¶..$50 Ariana Grande Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è.

Just recently bought the samples to these three and i'm not all into them  to me both the hayley kiyoko and Balenciaga ones smell like a rich auntie. They don't stink at all! They smell good actually, but they're a little too feminine/floral/mature for me. Right now I'm into more neutral fragrances.

As for marc Jacobs daisy - smells like something fresh, like water and watermelon.  It is feminine  smelling. Smells more casual. I can see myself wearing this one durinf the spring and summer.

Perfumes,quick review: Rag + Bone Oddity," I ordered a few masculine and unisex samples and fell in love with this scent! My usual perfume preference is hyper feminine gourmand or floral, but I was looking for a gift for the hubs. I picked out 'Encens"" by Rag + Bone because it was described as having a smoky incense-like profile, then I grabbed 'Oddity' on a whim as well. Encens is nice, but I think Oddity nails the incense vibe even better, and also reminds me of camping because of the woody notes. It is long lasting on the skin and I can't stop sniffing my wrist. It evokes a lot of warmth, spice, and smoke, and is very natural and down to earth. I think I will keep this one for me, heheh!",2022-05-28 18:00:31

in what i do know, i will definitely stray away from wild spicy and vanilla scents because it tends to make me nauseous...   i'm still quite young, so i don't want to go to sexy and mature scents yet. i know fruity scents are my safer scents, but i'd like to check for other scents that i might like better. 

so far in what i've seen, i think i'm interested in le labo santal 33 and chanel no.5 (50/50) because of their longevity and sillage. zara tobacco collection rich/warm/addictive, alkemia deus ex machina, and chris rusak after every ounce of joy has also caught my eye, mainly because of their tobacco and motor oil notes, though i haven't got a clue where or how i'll be able to get it + i'm still new and this might be quite a big jump for me.

1. Breath of the Wild = ""Philosykos"" by Diptyque (the fig leaf would seem like one of the ingredients for the recipes Link has to make lol)
2. Animal Crossing = ""Wood Sage and Sea Salt"" by Jo Malone (The cedar trees in the game, mixed with the close shores of the beach)
3. Yuppie Psycho: Executive Edition = ""Not a Perfume"" by Juliette Has a G\*n (Since its a horror game that takes place in an office, the strangeness of this scent goes well with the theme)",2022-05-31 16:50:21

Perfumes,Finding a Leather Lesbian Scent?,"Have been brainstorming what I want to smell like now that my last perfume bottle is out (Rentless from Lush, too sweet for me now but nonetheless sexy). I need help. I'm a mid 20s sapphic that wears a lot of leather and the classic black Levis/wifepleaser. I'm a bartender, Aquarius, drive a manual, preferred drink is a Negroni. I read a lot of nonfiction. Not as sensitive and tender as I would like to be. I'm a no touch top, dating history is all women with severe Catholic trauma (not on purpose) and if its not absolutely gritty sloppy terrifyingly decadent, I don't want it.

I want to smell like: your fingers after you've made ten Old Fashioneds in a row, repenting for a sin so delicious that it will never taste as good as the first time, 90s LA lesbian hookah lounge, the towel I use to wipe off my hands when I change my oil, End of Evangelion, candle that's burned slightly too long due to an engrossing first date, the last sliver of amber getting driven into the horizon at dusk, tasting sweat from a lover's neck, exhaust ballooning out of an 87' El Camino, walking into the New Mexico desert never to be seen again. 

Likes: leather, resin, woody scents, smelling like a church but in a sexy way

Dislikes: sweet cloying scents, large sillage, vanilla, hyper-masculine scents

Also maybe it's because there hasn't been any major shipment of them going in, or production by viktor&amp;Rolf is not very big because i have heard is sold out from other countries too.

Perfumes,signature scents for an alt/metalhead aesthetic?,"hi! i actually don't have much experience with perfume, but i do like to smell good and i'd like to establish a signature scent that fits my aesthetic. 

like i said in the title, i prefer to dress in a generally alternative way. think lots of black, fishnets, metal band shirts, leather jackets, ripped clothing, big chunky black boots, flannels, etc.

i'd like more androgynous scents that aren't too sweet. i had Happy by Clinique for a while, and i liked the fresh, clean smell it had. but it was a completely random gift from my aunt, so i was looking to find something a little more me. maybe something sorta dark and mysterious, something that smells like the mountains or backstage at a rock concert. i'm totally down with niche, edgy, offbeat kind of scents. i'm young and don't have a lot of money, so i would prefer scents on the cheaper end of the spectrum.

thanks!",2022-06-07 19:03:56
Perfumes,Need more layering/blending ideas,"Okay, fragrance folks, I need some tips and suggestions. 

I have never had much success with layering/blending scents until now. I am 60 with drier (of course) skin and fragrances no longer smell as well or last as long for me - even oils. Now I have found this beautiful combo of Spears' Fantasy Intimate Edition and You from Glossier. 

When I first sampled Glossier's ""You"" (I think it was in a sub box), I fell IN LOVE &amp; had to have it. I got both the solid in a compact and a bottle of the perfume. I loved, loved, loved the solid but the bottled perfume was a huge waste of $60 &amp; I was ticked. I finished the compact (and thank goodness they have brought it back!) but the bottle has been sitting on my vanity. Every now and then I would use a spritz to see if aging made it better (it didn't).

The other day, I made a blind buy of Britney Spears' Fantasy Intimate Edition. Fragrantica's listing of the ""accords"" was everything I want in a fragrance - especially the first 4: vanilla, sweet, musky, powdery. 

I was really disappointed with the initial scent. Too child-like and sickly-floral on me. The dry-down was better but nothing like I expected. On a whim. I spritzed some You on top and... Good mercy! This is divine. The layering smells like the original sample (and solid) of You.

I need to try layering and blending fragrances more. This combo lasted for hours and hours - from 10-ish one morning until it muted down to a ""skin scent"" the next morning around 7 when I got up. 

I like those vanilla/caramel and powdery scents the most. Any suggestions are appreciated.",2022-06-07 20:40:23
Perfumes,Looking for name of a perfume!,"Hey all! So I have been planning on buying this one perfume I have wanted for ages, but it was saved on my phone which was recently stolen and I can't remember what it was called! I searched everywhere for it but I can't find it so I was hoping someone here might be able to help &lt;3

So it's a perfume that is kind of woody and i think musky, and the bottle has tentacles on it. I don't know if this helps, but a few weeks ago I saw someone on tiktok mention it and they were saying it smells like pirate ships and the ocean. Also I don't think it was very expensive, maybe ranging from 50 Euro to 150 depending on volume.

Any help appreciated &lt;3",2022-06-07 21:30:51
Perfumes,What your thoughts of Viking by Creed??,"My father who is in his late 60s believes that it smells like the Original Paco Rabanne of his youth, of course he is fougere lover.. Viking does have that traditional aromatic fougere opening has that citrus, lavender &amp; lots of mint.

However, the dry down reminds me a lot of JPG Le Male, it feels premium and well blended, projecting and sillage is a beast, but Creed pricing $$$ I just cant digest paying premium for a 80s fougere.

Perfumes,Viktor &amp; Rolf BonBon review,"I've been searching around for a new perfume that I would be able to wear daily and I picked up Viktor and Rolf BonBon today at ulta. 

As someone who is relatively new to the perfume world I think this scent is a great place to start.  

The sweet citrus and floral top notes lure you in and then dries down to a sweet soft caramel  that reminds me of waffle cone and fruity gelato. 

Wearing this scent I really feel like that sweet innocent girl next door and on a hot day like today I feel like melting ice cream. 

I was worried it would be too strong and sweet  but once it dries down I feel that it is a bit light. 

I was hoping for a stronger peach aspect but overall it's more of a strong caramel with a little bit of fruit. 

Overall I enjoy this perfume and think it will be nice for daily wear",2022-06-12 06:14:36

Perfumes,Why is it so hard to find the perfect one?,"I know threads on overrated/underrated fragrance brands exist in this sub, but it's mainly about mentioning what brands.

I went on a hunt for a new fragrance, after the one I have got over and I didn't even realise. This one I've been using for since almost 11 years ! I decided to look for something new after friends/family/colleagues opined I need to make a change and explore the plethora of options that exist and not be stuck over one. I guess they were right, I needed to look for something different.

So in the last two days, I went to some luxury stores in my city which typically stock most popular fragrance brands from around the world. Naturally I was not in a state to try out all the brands, as I felt I was going to get a headache after nonstop smelling of fragrances. But even after trying many popular brands, I wasn't able to lock down on any brand and I felt utterly disappointed.

I felt many of the popular brands I smelled like Dior, Channel, Hermes, YSL, Pacco Rabana, Creed, etc were not anything mind-blowing or match the hype that many make them out to be.

Is it that I am too used to the one I have been using so I'm not finding any other ones interesting? Many a times, in public, like in the elevator or somewhere I smell some amazing fragrances of a person around or even someone that just passed by a while back and the smell that lingers in the air. I like those ones but obviously I'm unable to know what these are.

In the store, however, all the ones sprayed on those perfume testing strips or even on my wrists , felt too overpowering and I found it hard to make out the actual smell as I was constantly smelling new ones, with coffee beans in between. But still I couldn't detect what it would actually smell like on a person. On strips it's too intense, to the point I was almost getting a headache.

So I'd like to know how to go about looking for a new fragrance? Especially as someone who has stuck to using just one fragrance since last 11years. Should I start by looking for a similar smelling one? And gradually move on to ones with very different notes? I have been doing some research on fragrantica website.

Or should I take my chance with the popular brands with the hope I'd probably like them once I start wearing them on my body compared to smelling them off testing strips? There were some fragrances in the store I felt were decent, but I remained confused so didn't decide on any.

I know fragrances are a very subjective issue, so each one will like a certain smell differently. I'd just like to know the method of finding the perfect one. If someone who has or can share how they found their perfect perfume can help.",2022-06-13 00:07:25

Thanks in advance for anyone willing to help me",2022-06-13 11:39:35
Perfumes,I‚Äôve been obsessed with this scent but I want it in a perfume,"If anyone uses Caudalie‚Äôs Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk cleanser you should know the scent I‚Äôm talking about. 

Sephora says the scent is ‚Äò100% sweet almond‚Äô but I always assumed almond had a slight bitter note, nothing like the soft, sweet scent of this cleanser. 

The highlighted ingredients are Sweet Almond Oil, Castor Oil, and Cornflower Water, so that could be why it smells a little different. 

Anyways I was really hoping to find a perfume, Fragrance oil, even body wash or shampoo that matched this scent because I have been obsessed with it, does anyone have any recommendations?",2022-06-13 12:05:32

I've been looking for a certain perfume for a while now and I can't find it again. Unfortunately I have barely any information to go on, this is all I've got.

\- It is transparent, clear glass but has dark blue or black stripes on the sides around the round front. 

\- I think it has the word ""rose"" or ""ros√©"" on it.

I was lucky enough to visit the Aftelier before covid... It was so nice to get a google notification and learn more about her!!!

https://preview.redd.it/prm49m4ctrw81.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0523cba59aa84b3d11b05c9a54a3ecd6e236f7a

*Here's the start of the article:*

*A woman leaves a room, and her* *perfume* *lingers. She is gone, but something of her presence remains. The woman, perfumer* [*Mandy Aftel*](https://www.aftelier.com/)*, has slipped into another wing of her home in search of a relic.*¬†

*Scents are like souls, Marcel* *Proust* *wrote. They endure death and destruction, ""remembering, waiting, hoping...""*

*Fragrances are alive for Aftel, too. She calls them ""my friends,"" and once charmingly addressed a shelf of* *essential oils* *directly, asking, ""Is everybody here?""*

*Aftel is heir to a tradition that* *traces back* *six thousand years to* *Egypt**,  where incense was burned to purify sacred spaces. Later, in  Mesopotamia, the desire for more complex aromatics inspired some of  humanity's earliest chemistry experiments. One* *cuneiform tablet*  *dating to 1200 BC names the world's first-recorded chemist, a female  perfumer named Tapputi. From that era onward, precious fragrances  proliferated via the Silk Road, reached mass adoption in the ""Perfumed  Court"" of King Louis XV, and currently comprise a* *30 billion dollar* *global industry that includes Aftel's cozy atelier here in Berkeley, California.*¬†¬†¬†

*The seventy-four-year-old returned clutching a notebook. ""This is  it,"" she announced. The pages document seasons of struggle as the artist  attempted to recreate the precise natural scent of someone she had  loved and lost ‚Äì a perfume she would eventually name* [*Memento Mori*](https://www.aftelier.com/Memento-Mori-Eau-de-Parfum-Spray-p/liq-edp-mementomori.htm)*. ""The process mirrored the relationship itself,"" she confessed. ""Torturous.""*

*It had been a solitary period, reminiscent of the perfumer's  childhood in 1950s Detroit. Growing up in a synthetic miasma of  ""asphalt, detergent, and chlorinated swimming pools,"" the scents of her  youth were unfriendly ones.*",2022-05-01 09:55:52

im not rly knowledgeable in the way of perfumery, but i'm trying to find a perfume to stick to / signature scent. problem is, idk what i like or don't like (general trends). my favorite perfumes (that i've tried so far, age 21) are guerlain's shalimar, tom ford's black orchid and the newest fave addition is narciso rodriguez's pure musc (which is quite different to the 2 previous ones, isn't it? i feel like it's more of a light summer scent). recently i looooved dsquared2's original (i don't care if it's„Äämale„Äãor„Ääfemale„Äãperfume btw). d&amp;g's l'imperatrice was alright too but too... sweet? mild? soft?? for me. i didn't like any of the bvlgari omnias i've tried &amp; i didn't like guerlain's insolence (too flowery).

Perfumes,Signature scent help,"hey, guys so im a teen girl. I need a signature scent. my goal is to have people remember me by it and a routine I can stay consistent with. In terms of the scent I want to smell good, a mix of sweet and floral and just fresh/clean. Basically, something I can wear at school, at parties, fancy events, basically a signature to me so it has to be appropriate for all types of events.  I already have a lot of perfumes just have trouble choosing. 

Some of my favourites are: 

\- tease by victories secret (this is my favourite but I don't know what to layer it with and it barely lasts but the scent is my personal favourite. I am trying to pair it with the Brazillian bum bum lotion from sole de Janeiro and it smells good just really expensive.)

\- bombshell by victories secret (smells good but its a little fancier for school and that in my opinion let me know if you think differently)

\- heavenly by victorias secret (this is a super clean, non-offensive scent and I like it but I want a young sweetish floral hint to it too which it doesn't give me) 

\- I also have a lot of bath and body works my favs are a thousand wishes and champagne toast but I want something more unique for me so I'm not sure this is the best as it's very basic and not very long-lasting. 

Please let me know your thoughts as well as any cheap signature scent recommendations you have for me to wear everywhere. If anyone has any nice layering products with any of the perfumes I mentioned, Pls let me know!!",2022-05-05 02:47:54

Perfumes,"as someone sensitive to smells, what should i get for my first perfume?","Hi, so I'm a 22 year old woman and I've been thinking of getting a proper eu de parfum for myself. However I do have certain sensitivities so I hope someone can help with a suitable recommendation.

It's not necessarily all smells that bothers me but specific smells. Smelling bad and some other stuff triggers anxiety and headaches (Just broken brain stuff). And I get over stimulated easily so having a familiar scent that I like wafting around really helps to ground myself.

I get migraines too, so I could never get cheap perfumes where the alcohol just hits you in the face. I also can't stand those ""ocean"" kinds as well as musky, woody scents.

I've been wearing BBW's Vanilla Sugar but it doesn't last long, it's just the only one from BBW that doesn't give me migraines because it's subtle and not overpowering. Plus back when I wasn't working, it's cheap haha

I like sweet, vanilla-y scents, the kind that smells yummy. Floral is ok. I'm willing to try fruity/citrusy as long as it's not super strong. Not so much a ""fresh"" feeling but more homely? Comforting smell.

I will be wearing it everyday. Don't really have a budget as long as it's not ridiculously expensive I'm okay with it.

Also I live in a tropical, humid climate that's sunny all year round and I'm not too sure if the malls here stock anything other than the popular brands, so I will probably not be able to purchase anything indie.

Thanks for the help!!",2022-05-15 17:26:19

recently I bought myself Tom Ford‚Äôs Tobacco Vanille and as a newbie to the fragrance world, after a couple of uses, I shook it once or twice. I have not sprayed it for about 2,5 days after shaking.

Perfumes,":) Recommendations for clean, fresh scents!","Hello! I‚Äôm hoping someone reads this and would like to give me (F20) a recommendation on a fragrance to buy! It would be awesome. I‚Äôm looking for a fresh scent, that is feminine yet not too flowery/sweet/fruity or musky/gourmand/oriental, also not too chemical, that you could wear to any occasion all year round. All price ranges. The ‚Äúclean smell‚Äù is so lovely, especially if it has a signature to it, like fresh sheets but more fragrance-like. My only concerns with this type of smell are that one would end up smelling like a 2$ soap if you know what I mean, I hope to avoid that, or simply smelling boring. Another smell I like is the woody, cedar type of smell which I guess contradicts what I previously said, but maybe there's a combination out there somewhere. The only fragrance I‚Äôve smelled for longer periods is Good Girl - Carolina Herrera, it was too musky/oriental/vanilla/chocolate for me and I didn‚Äôt really like it. I do have two smells I liked and became obsessed with, a pair of fragrance sticks, the scents are explained like this:

‚ÄúAntique Green‚Äù: A fresh herbal scent with notes of melon, peach, lily of the valley and cedarwood.

‚ÄúWhite Satin‚Äù: A clean scent with notes of orchid, jasmine, lily of the valley and cedarwood.

I know little about perfume so I hope I could explain the scent I‚Äôm looking for a little at least, hopefully someone reads and has a recommendation! Have a good day :)",2022-03-30 17:12:13

Perfumes,Help me find the perfume of my dreams/memories?,"Hi everyone,

I have been searching for a very special fragrance for years, but because I can only describe it from memory, it has been a little difficult. When I was 9, in 2005 or 2006, my aunt gave me a sample spray of a lemony, rich, sweet, delicious perfume. I DOUSED myself in it because I was so proud to have a bottle of perfume, and because I was so proud that my aunt chose to give it to me. I recall it smelled like Italian lemon, maybe even a little like lemon cake, though I recall its tartness. I remember it being in a rectangular bottle, and perhaps this is a figment of my imagination, but I vaguely recall a lemon being on the bottle. This may or may not be true. All I know for certain is it was lemon HEAVY. Does anyone recall a fragrance from the 2000s that sounds like this? I would love to reexperience it.",2022-04-01 11:05:06

Perfumes,"Looking for a certain ""Christmas cookie"" type scent","About ten years ago around Christmas time, I was working distribution in a post office. As I was sorting packages I came across a scent that has haunted me ever since. The smell was coming from one of the packages, I think, but we were so busy and I never got to figure out which package it was before I sorted them all out to the carriers for the day...

It smelled like freshly baked sugar cookies combined with a kind of pine tree scent. And maybe a snowy smell-or what you'd think snow smelled like - But the prevailing smell was that of freshly baked cookies with sugared crystals on top. But also with like a pine tree snow smell. It's frustrating because I can't really explain it accurately. But I would know it if I smelled it again which sadly has not happened yet. I have tried all kinds of ""holiday"" themed scents from different places and nothing has come close. 

I am beginning to think that my memory has distorted how brilliant the smell was and perhaps it wasn't as magical as I remembered.  Does anyone have any suggestions? 

*it's possible that the smell was actually baked cookies being sent in the mail which is what everyone at work told me. But I really think it could've been coming from a bundle of magazines that had perfume samples in it (?) I mean that's a possibility as well. I swear it had like a perfumed quality to it that made me think that it wasn't actual cookies",2022-04-03 23:06:13

Perfumes,I made a mistake - Delina,"I made the mistake of ordering a small sample of Delina a while ago in another order. I hadn't smelled the sample for a couple of months as I forgot about it. I decided to try it this morning and see how it wears on my skin, not expecting to love it because I don't typically go for florals like that. 

Oh my god. I hate to say that I love this so so much because it's so painfully expensive, even on discount sites and eBay shipping where I am is always really pricey. 

I have a feeling this one is hard to replicate or come close to, but if anyone has a similar scent recommendation that has good to excellent lasting power, that would be so great. I know nothing is like the real thing but

Each time I go to sample perfumes I don't like the recommended scents and I'm starting to think I'm describing my taste wrong.

Perfumes I've loved: 

Clean Reserve - Solar Bloom

Armani - Acqua di Gioia

Nest - Sunkissed Hibiscus (most worn currently but feels a bit too floral at times. I love the warmth.)

Elizabeth and James - Nirvana White and Nirvana Black (two of my favorites but now discontinued ): )

&amp;#x200B;

Perfumes I don't like: 

Le Labo - Santal 33 (too woody)

MFK - Baccarat Rouge 540 (based on descriptions I thought I would love this. It's too musky / heavy on me)

Burberry - Her London Dream (too sweet)

Perfumes,Looking for recommendations on a floral scented perfume,"I had a perfume as a teenager that I liked a lot. It was Mary Kay‚Äôs tribute perfume. The version I had was the 90‚Äôs scent. If I‚Äôm correct they redid the formula in like 2002 and made it more fruity scented. That‚Äôs not the one I had or am remembering. It was my first ‚Äúadult‚Äù perfume and I liked it a lot, but they discontinued it. While I did like the perfume I feel like there is something better out there that I will love. 

What I really liked about MK perfume was the primarily sweet floral scent. I want to literally smell like I bathed in flower nectar, honey, and sunlight. I think it also had a slight almost powdery undertone if I remember right. It was very feminine. My favorite perfume right now is Roses de Chloe which to me has a light sweet floral scent but is not too sweet. It‚Äôs absolutely wonderful, but it‚Äôs not quite perfect. Sometimes I mix it with a tiny tiny bit of vanilla scented perfume that almost exactly hits home for what I‚Äôm looking for. I think it adds a cozy warmth to it that gives it a little something something. 

I‚Äôm not super knowledgeable about perfumes so I‚Äôm sorry if my explanation isn‚Äôt very good. I spent two hours at Sephora with an employee who was determined to find the right perfume for me. That‚Äôs how I found the roses de Chloe. Apparently I have a very specific idea of what I want and it‚Äôs hard to find haha. If you can recommend something I‚Äôd really appreciate it.

I haven't done it yet bc I'm kinda afraid and think it might be horrible and clash but then I thought that the fruity floral  pomegranate, yuzu, raspberry, peony, lotus, and magnolia and the sensual musk and amber of the bright crystal absolu might mix well with the tropical passion fruit nectar, the floral tiger orchid, and sweet gourmand vanilla and jasmine honey.

What do you all think? And if you think it's a good idea, which should I spray first?",2022-04-11 07:48:58
Perfumes,Givenchy Amarige - stronger scent in store? Trying to find if formula of tester is different.,"I tried Givenchy's Amarige EDT at a Macy's, and loved the scent. It lasted so long and I loved how the notes evolved on my skin.

I ordered the smaller 1.7oz version on their website, and it is noticeably weaker. It faded to a sweeter vanilla base then I originally smelled from the store tester bottle, doesn't last nearly as long, and isn't as pleasant as what I tried in store.

From comparing batch codes, I found that the store tester was made in April 2020, and the one I received was made in June 2021. Anyone know if there was a change in formula during this time? Or how can I find a list of formula changes and dates for this fragrance?",2022-04-11 08:24:42

Perfumes,Is Zara‚Äôs Leather jardin a dupe? Looking for similar perfumes,"Leather jardin is one of the perfumes in Zara‚Äôs collab with Jo Malone. I was not planning on checking perfumes but I was super stressed at Zara, in line for a return, when I saw the bottle. The elegant and classic vibe really got to me and when I smelled it I couldn‚Äôt believe it, it‚Äôs old school and intense but feminine and mature, totally my kind of perfume. I was totally transported to my happiest place. I live in Stockholm and everyone here is obsessed with Byredo, everyone smells good but also the same, the range is very narrow. My favourite perfumes are Aromatics Elixir by Clinique and Infusion d‚Äôiris by Prada, so quite at odds with what‚Äôs popular around here (this makes me nervous every time I go to a perfume store, I don‚Äôt check too much). Anyway, I got the Zara perfume and it‚Äôs become my absolute favourite. I‚Äôm curious, does anyone know if it‚Äôs a dupe? If so, of what? Or, what are similar perfumes? I know what I like but I don‚Äôt know how to look for it so any advice would be great. Fragrantica describes the accords as leather/animalic/citrus/smoky. Other accords I‚Äôve noticed in my favourite perfumes are musk, warm spicy, white floral, amber and woods.",2022-04-11 21:19:41

Perfumes,Something similar to Flower L'√©lixir by Kenzo?,"I am no perfume connoisseur by any means, so please help and I hope I do an okay job at describing what I am looking for. This is my favorite evening fragrance. Definitely my go-to scent when going out. It's sensual, sweet, powdery but not disgustingly sweet (to me) or overhwelming and well balanced with the florals. I really like the praline and raspberry in it. 

I'm looking for something similar to it. Not necessarily similar notes (although that would be preferable since it's discontinued and very hard to find nowadays), but just a similar vibe, if that makes sense - dark and sweet but sophisticated and not headache inducing.

I tried Black Opium EDP and Hypnotic Poison EDP and did not like either. Good Girl EDP by Carolina Herrera was just okay to me. I really liked Tom Ford Noir Pour Femme. 

Thank you üò≠",2022-02-26 04:56:12

The only one that has a different smell other than alcohol is Mugler‚Äôs Angel, Escada‚Äôs sorbetto rosso and victoria secret perfume the vanilla one and Love Spell.. like seriously every single perfume just smells the same except doe those 2! 
I wonder why this is happening only to me.. when i go to buy perfume i smell some and the clerk is trying to make me buy one and all i say is that they all smell nice but not enough for me to spend money on! They are smell cheap and generic even the really expensive ones. I had such high hopes for DKNY be delicious and Burberry Her and Flower by KENZO yet all of them smell like my grandma‚Äôs cheap no name brand perfume it‚Äôs insane! 
I dont know whats wrong with me or maybe my nose can only pick up Angel smell or Watermelon smell but it‚Äôs so annoying when wanting to actually buy a perfume i like :( 
i tested around 10 perfumes today and literally every single one smelled the same

His is looking for an off the radar perfume, that can be marking enough for people to correlate to him whenever they smell it, and giving him the vibe he is looking for.  


He wasn't able to give me enough info on what he wanted, only that he didnt want anything too sweet, probably more inclined towards a leather, woody or smoked vibe, but gave me a visual representation. ""Imagine a man, drinking whiskey, in a crimsom lighted room, sitting next to a fireplace"". So basically he wants to look like Thomas Shelby...

The fragrances is inspired by the power and calmness of nature and It's a fragrance that is not in a liquid state, but in a natural solid state. Perhaps that's part of its appeal.

 While being solid, its design includes a capsuled shell made from an Zamak alloy that can handle the wear and tear of daily use all while being extremely portable - you can take it anywhere with you! 

 It‚Äôs called Aroma | 59 and it‚Äôs made with alcohol-free, natural anhydrous wax base that they say melts onto your skin with the warmth of your body.  

The really cool thing is that it was launched on Kickstarter and in just 13 mins of going live - the project was fully funded.

Perfumes,I'm overwhelmed by what clones I should be focusing on making...so help me out: Which clone should I make next? And also what do you guys think of cloning high-end fragrances ? :),"Hey guys! I'm Nawar and I'm a huge scent enthusiast. You could say it's kind of my life's passion.

But you know what? The whole world of high-end fragrances has always felt a little too exclusive to me, and too expensive. Like, why should only the richest 1% be able to enjoy the smells that they want to wear?

So I did what any smart internet entrepreneur would do: I started cloning them.

Now look, I know some of you are thinking: ""That's not cool, man!"" But it totally is. And yeah some of ya'll be thinking ""This guy's a copycat!"" But let me ask you this: do you think Gucci copied Ralph Lauren when they came out with their signature polo shirt? No! They just saw something cool and wanted to make their own version of it. Some of these companies charge $400+ for a bottle of perfume that costs them $20-50 to make. And they'll tell you it's because they're using rare ingredients cultivated from the tears of unicorns or something, but please. It's all just marketing BS.

So yeah, my clones probably aren't going to smell exactly like the real thing, and yeah some do smell better than originals (at least that's what my customers tell me which is hilarious because it should be impossible haha), but if you want to try out some new scents without breaking the bank‚Äîor if you just think these luxury brands are charging way too much for their products‚ÄîI'm your guy.

I'm now overwhelmed with what to clone next, so I'm taking suggestions from you all and will choose my next project based on which fragrance gets the most upvotes in this thread. Don't be shy‚Äîplease suggest away!",2022-03-07 07:47:18

After about 5 minutes of googling I stumbled onto ‚ÄúThe perfume Guy‚Äù and his YouTube channel, and was watching his review of grand Soir and comparison to Absolu pour le Soir. I didn‚Äôt know I could be so intrigued by listening to someone talk about note listings and the description of a fragrance, but I found myself in the car the next day heading to Neiman Marcus just to smell Grand Soir‚Ä¶.. As I walked in a young woman within a few years of my age asked if she could point me in a direction, and when I mentioned being here to smell MFK fragrances she immediately told me I had good taste ü§£üòÇ. Grand Soir was the first fragrance I checked out, and it was head over heels love at first sniff! Fast forward 3 months and 6 new designer fragrances/multiple grand Soir samples later and I just grabbed a big bottle of grand Soir with the full intention of making it my signature scent! Sorry for the long post I‚Äôm just really hyped on this new passion, I love learning about things that I think are cool and perfumery and fragrances have become an absolutely obsession already‚Ä¶.",2022-03-08 16:46:26

Backstory: Vincenzo Spinnato has developed a unisex fragrance by request of the Garland family to celebrate the 100th birthday of Judy Garland. It will be revealed June of this year at an event in LA and my girlfriend, Tori, has been invited to cover the event because she is a TikTok personality with a modest following. However her expertise is in Wizard of Oz, not cosmetic chemistry! 

Her and I have brainstormed various questions about the Judy connection, but we have no idea what questions experienced perfume/fragrance people would ask one another about their process.

It opens up with sweet citrusy notes - Calabrian bergamot, Brazilian orange, grapefruit and pineapple. Then, the heart notes are coconut, damask plum, lily-of-the-valley, jasmine sambac, leather and RASPBERRY which give a tropical, floral and fruity scent (WOW, who thought raspberries can give such a special scent??) and this leads to an amazinggg dry down of a soft, almond-like vanilla caramel note.

Oh, this is a wonderful fragrance. I am so glad I got to smell this masterpiece.

Perfumes,Exposed to a new beautiful fragrance :),"Ok so while my Euro trip I got exposed to this new perfume F.da Montefeltro by V Canto. 

It has a great opening of fresh, clean and citrusy fragrance with lovely floral, sweet, cozy and woody middle notes thanks to the ylang-ylang, flowers, amber and gurjan balsam. When I first sprayed it on myself, the first thing that I smelled were the flowers. Oh, that opening is so beautiful, freshy and obsessing. 

Then this beautiful fragrance dries down to a dark, soft, woody scent with a slightly pinch of vanilla which makes it warmer and cozier and feel like running in the forest while warm wind is coming towards us. In my opinion, the fact that it has vanilla in the dry down, yes even that pinch of vanilla, makes me fall for it not only because I love the smell of vanilla but also the warmth it gives and how cozy it makes the fragrance feel on my skin. 

LOVELY!

Perfumes,How do you put perfume in aluminum bottles?,"Hello!

Ive been trying to make a pefume of my own recently for a school project, and i have a design in mind for the bottle where it would be made out of aluminum. Unfortunately from some quick googling Ive found out that putting ethanol in aluminum bottles isnt the best idea due to the ethanol in the perfume corroding the bottle which makes the perfume smell metalic.

Ive been looking for a way to prevent this and the two ways that Ive found to avoid this is to either put another bottle inside made out of a less reactive material like glass, which is a big hassle and effects the design of the product, or to coat the inside of the bottle with a thin layer of material that is less reactive to ethanol. I would prefer to go with the second option but through my research I havent been able to figure out what is normally used in this situation and i was hoping that the kind people on Reddit could help me.

An example of an aluminum spray bottle that has this coating: [https://www.cnshining.com/product/aluminum-perfume-bottle](https://www.cnshining.com/product/aluminum-perfume-bottle)

I just bought the Versace Pour Homme EDT from a pretty big online retailer here in Belgium (bol.com), and I'm kind of suspicious of the packaging. I paid ‚Ç¨57,95 for 100ml (3.4 US fl.oz.). The plastic wrapping looks really amateuristic compared to other perfume brands I bought, and in the ingredient list every first letter of every word is capitalized (which looks weird to me).

Perfumes,Black XS for her EDT vs EDP,"Hi there!

So, in the past I used to be obsessed with Black XS for her, and had the EDT and Black XS L‚Äôexces. They have been discontinued as you all probably know, but I may have managed to find a new bottle of the Black XS EDT (looks the same as it used to). 


However, I remembered that there is a new one, and it‚Äôs an EDP, so I am debating if I should just get that one. 

I have smelled both, and even though there is a slight difference, I would be happy with either of them, scent-wise. One of my most important criteria for perfumes is longevity, which is why I‚Äôm considering the EDP, but I do know that of course, it‚Äôs not always the case that EDPs are more long lasting than EDT. The old EDT used to be a beast in longevity. 


So, if anyone has had both of these or has some thoughts or recommendations, I would be happy to hear them! 

Thanks!",2022-01-31 08:36:46

Perfumes,How to a choose signature perfume in just 4 steps |,"
Now that we've understood in previous blogs already that fragrances fall into different price ranges and they can be either most expensive or just in the budget that's totally up to us because we decide the range beforehand. Now let's discuss how we can go and pick the perfect fragrance for ourselves or our loved ones. We know¬†""the types of signature scents¬†And¬† 

How to choose a perfume according to your age and liking.


Now it's time to go and shop for that happy fragrance.



Pick up a good store¬†:


Always pick a store where the staff knows what they're dealing with and how they can provide the best to their customers. Because some stores do not have a staff which is familiar with fragrances so avoid going to those stores. Whereas picking up a store which has eligible staff that can assist you properly. Tell them your preferences and budget and they'll help you get the exact fragrance that you want. Some recommended fragrances are¬†bath and body works, titan, marks, and spencers. These are the brands that can be trusted without having tried.

How to try perfumes:

Do not sniff so many perfumes at once because this can confuse the decision by many folds. Firstly to get the idea of the perfume sniff from the cap only because this will give the idea that you will like that fragrance or not.


Note that the fragrance which is making you feel like you would want to and give you happiness and confidence is the perfect fragrance for you.


If you want to try many fragrances avoid putting them on yourself ask for the blotter sheets and sprit the fragrance on it leave it to set for 10-20 seconds and then sniff from a distance this will help the top note to set and the fragrance will be more clear.¬†



Things to keep in mind while shopping for perfume/EDP:


* Don't just go and pick the fragrance in one go just because you like the top note of it perfumes have a good amount of alcohol in them and after some time it evaporates and you might dislike the fragrance of it later.¬†


* Do not wear any kind of fragrance before going to buy one.


* While switching one fragrance to another fragrance just give your nose a natural scent on either of your shirts, your skin, or go outside to get the smell of nature so that you don't feel overwhelmed by the fragrances.¬†


Pick the one perfect perfume:


When you have decided on a perfume ""wear it"". Wear the fragrance that you feel most attracted to. Do not spritz it on your clothes directly as it contains alcohol that can stain the cloth. Also, you can keep blotter sheets with yourself or just ask for a sample of that particular perfume to try before you buy. As perfumes are expensive and people don't buy them just because they find the bottle attractive. These stores always keep samples with them. So just go ahead and ask for one, tell them you are thinking of buying this perfume but you need to be sure before you buy it and they'll be happy to give you a sample of it which you can use just to be sure.



Wait for a day - Wearing a fragrance doesn't make any sense if at the end of the day you can't even smell it. Just wait for a whole day and see how it works ""if it lasts longer on you or not"", ""if the people you are surrounded by like it or they find it irritable"" you'll know whether it works for you or against you!


Observe everything related to your perfume :

Observe - All the notes carefully they must be liked by you because some perfumes have the best top notes but they get mixed up with the body odor and make it worse by the end of the day it can smell pathetic so pay attention, it's important to observe how it works on your skin type.


When you've observed the notes of the perfume and know if you like it or not just decide and get that large bottle for yourself to spread the charm of your personality. You'll see a good fragrance can make a lot of changes to your personality and when you decide to change your fragrance go ahead and find a new one.


If you still don't reach your fragrance:


If you've tried all the steps and still think that you like more than one fragrance then also you have a lot of choices you should go ahead and buy the¬†combo packs¬†of smaller bottles or the¬†tester packs.¬† 

Now that you have decent knowledge about how to buy the perfect fragrance you can go ahead and get one for yourself confidently. These points will help you select the right one so get yourself the best fragrance that suits you and your personality like magic.",2021-12-27 16:37:27
Perfumes,'Stronger With You Intensely' or 'By The Fireplace',"I'm deciding between these two fragrances but do not know what to get.

Perfumes,Signature scent for my aesthetic,"I have been using Giorgio Armani Acqua Di Gioia for a long time now but would like to try something new.

The Aesthetic I'm Looking For: Evoking an imagery of striking gorgeousness in a dreamy/ethereal way. Delicate yet commanding personality. Femme fatale but in a little sundress. Something that may also evoke nostalgia of a time gone by (like shalimar but not that strong). Of a time past that you long for but it will never happen again (say something classic or medieval or vintage). Something timeless.

I havent found any characters to explain what i am looking for but the basic idea i can give from historical novels is this lady who is very well trained with swords/martial arts but is also very gorgeous in a petite feminine way - strikingly gorgeous in an ethereal goddess way. I would like something that embodies commanding and imposing personality but a delicate feminine way of dress. Something that evokes a dark and cool nostalgia (in a dark academia way) but is also fresh (think grass, lime, mist, waterfalls).

A chilly, mystical and ethereal scent befitting the queen of the elves.

Notes I Like: Citrus, Aqua/ Water, Grass, waterfalls/mist, sandalwood, rosewater (so not as concentrated as rose), vanilla (not too strong but rather the lighter vanilla), snow, ice.  
I tend to get headaches from very strong or floral scents. I especially like those scents which feels chilly, fresh, delicate but still blatantly sexy/seductive.

I have been trying to find something like this for a long time but no success yet.",2022-01-02 00:34:05

Perfumes,First time making perfume with ethanol,"Hello, 

I dabble in perfume making as a hobby, I used to put 30% essential oils and top it up with an odorless oil (like jojoba oil). I was quite happy with the results. 

This time I tried to experiment with using ethanol. 
I put 30% essential oils, 40% jojoba oil as carrier, and 30% ethanol (perfumer's alcohol). I thought adding alcohol would help get better sillage and preserve the perfume longer.

I made the perfume but I'm not that impressed and I think the oils didn't mix well. Should I wait a couple of hours for the ethanol to do its magic and dissolve the essential oils? Should I have used alcohol and water instead of using a carrier oil?",2022-01-02 20:26:53

Perfumes,Madonna‚Äôs Truth or Dare,"I‚Äôm not into perfume at all, so I am at your mercy r/perfumes!

A few years ago I bought Madonna‚Äôs Truth or Dare for my mum. It was a blind buy, and I only picked it because my mum idolises Madonna- I lucked out, it actually smelled really good.

I tried to get her it again when she ran out, and by this point the prices were a lot higher and I was confused, did some digging and found it was discontinued. I managed to get her a smaller bottle for about as much as I paid last time.

Fast forward to now, my sister asked for it too. The price point it way too much for me now, even for the smallest bottle.

I googled around to find similar smelling perfumes but the ones recommended were even MORE expensive than what Truth or Dare is going for these days!

So I need your expert noses to help me find a perfume that is as close to Truth or Dare as possible while remaining in a less than ¬£30 price range. I‚Äôm not expecting miracles, I know at such a low cost, it‚Äôs not going to be exact, but we can try!

My limited knowledge of perfume has me understanding that there are different levels of scent, and I remember my sister describing it as flowery, so perfumes that are most similar in this aspect will beat out perfumes that maybe match other scents.

Perfumes,Which perfume from my collection should I use for which situation?,"Hello all,

I am now for about 2 years a perfume addict, like you all and now I have an accordingly quite large collection (in my eyes). Unfortunately, I am still unsure to which situation I can wear which perfume.

I would like to distinguish in the following categories:  
\- Winter fragrance  
\- Summer fragrance  
\- ""Date night"" or ""I'm going away for the weekend"" fragrance  
\- Office fragrance  
\- Causal fragrance

These are my current fragrances:  
1. Bleu de Channel - Parfum  
2. Allure Homme √âdition Blanche - EDP  
3. Allure Homme - EDT  
4. Allure Homme Sport Eau Extr√©me - EDP  
5. Dior Sauvage Elixir - Parfum  
6. YSL L'Homme Le Parfum - EDP  
7. YSL La Nuit De L'Homme Bleu √âlectrique - EDT  
8. YSL La Nuit De L'Homme - EDT  
9. YSL Y - EDP  
10. Versace Dylan Blue - EDT  
11. Versace Pour Homme - EDT  
12. Dolce Gabanna The One - EDP  
13. Armani Acqua Di Gio Profundo - EDP  
14. Armaf Club de Nuit - EDT

Could you guys help me with this or give me any ""tips""?  
Basically I had been wearing what my ex-girlfriend liked or I rotated through a bit. However, I myself am convinced by all the scents in the picture. :-)

I will of course accept other suggestions if a division is not sufficiently filled.

Perfumes,"And Ode to J‚Äôadore by Dior, an old timeless classic IMO","I‚Äôve been meaning to write this for some time since I purchased my first ever bottle of this perfume a few months ago. However this perfume has been known to me for awhile. 

I distinctly remember seeing magazine ads (with the little smelling sample) for this perfume when I was in middle school like mid 2000s. I thought it smelled amazing. I desperately wanted it. I think I asked for it for my birthday not knowing the price but it was absolutely out of the price range for my low middle class family and again I was like 13 years old so totally appropriate for my hardworking parents to NOT buy me a $100+ bottle of perfume. 

I would seek out similar scents sort of subconsciously over the next few years. Magnolia and jasmine stand out the most to me. I bought a magnolia body spray from bath and body works and used that forever into my college years, it‚Äôs since discontinued unfortunately. I‚Äôve had other jasmine perfumes.

Fast forward many years I‚Äôm now 30 and making a solid income, honestly I‚Äôm in a financial position beyond my wildest thoughts as a 13 year old. I finally decide to achieve this small at the time unattainable dream and buy this perfume Ive wanted forever. Such a satisfying feeling. It‚Äôs better than I remember. Hothouse floral aromas. Great lasting power. And I‚Äôm a fan of Charlize Theron who I remember from the old ads but had no idea who she was at the time. 

It‚Äôs a pretty mature scent but at the same time brings me back to my teenage hopes and aspirations.

I know it‚Äôs been a classic for a long time but maybe it‚Äôs not as trendy anymore since I don‚Äôt see it mentioned much here and it never seems front and center in big fancy department stores. Miss Dior seems to be a more front facing line for them now.",2022-01-08 12:08:40

I just bought a dior homme intense perfume for about 130‚Ç¨ from a very  renowned perfume shop here in Albania, I don't have any doubt about the perfumes authenticity but there was some discrepancy.
Under the box  it was written EDP as is should be, because homme intense comes only as EDP.
Meanwhile the bottle was as it should be and the cap aswell Homme intense., but under the bottle it was written EDT.
Te batch numbers correspondent as well.
The perfumes are quite similar so I couldn't tell which one is it.

Perfumes,getting addicted to buying perfumes,"last year, i started buying perfumes and gosh‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so addicting. i feel like many fragrances i smell are so nice in their own way i just have to buy them. 
it doesn‚Äôt help that i‚Äôm a broke college student and perfumes are expensive! 

i‚Äôm trying to stop buying full bottles and just get travel sizes, especially if i‚Äôm not sure i love them. but some of the full size bottles are just too cute üò≠ 

i‚Äôm definitely not into niche perfumes and don‚Äôt have a favorite type yet. still exploring and figuring out what i like. my first perfume was gifted to me by my sister. it‚Äôs Chanel Coco Mademoiselle. Although this perfume smells nice, it gave me a headache and just wasn‚Äôt right for me. I was also gifted Ralph Lauren Romance and Cartier le Baiser du Dragon. Again nice perfumes but not me. 

I went ahead and purchased Glossier You as an everyday perfume, Lanc√¥me Idole for something fancier. I love the dry down but dislike the citrus smell in the beginning. This is beginning to be more of my every day perfume now. I got Marc Jacobs Daisy because the bottle is so cute. Just purchased La Vie Est belle as well as a travel size of Olympea and Black Opium. Black opium smells so amazing! 


If I could, I would trade my Daisy for Daisy Love! And want to try JHAG not a perfume!

Perfumes,Searching for this smell for 19 years,"TLDR: Searching for a sandalwood/jasmine soft scent from my childhood for almost 20 years
-
My godmother gave me scented a√ßa√≠ beads when I was a child (at least 19 years ago) and they smelled absolutely magical and unlike anything I ever smelled.

As an adult, I realize the notes that get closest to it are sandalwood and jasmine. It wasn't a very sweet smell at all and it had no citrus or any other ""sharp"" notes. It was the type of smell you could just breath in. It didn't make your nose 'shut down' from the punchiness because it was very soft. 

I recently smelled [Fleur D'Oranger 27](https://www.lelabofragrances.com/fleur-doranger-27-134.html) by Le Labo and that gets close-ish but it has more citrus than the scent I've been searching for. 

Anyone has any thoughts on scents that could get me closer to it?",2022-01-12 06:47:44

Perfumes,"IIL fruity scents, flowery scents, sensual/sexy scents and tropical scents WEWIL","I CAN'T STAND LAVENDER, it gives me headaches, and I'm not a huge cinnamon fan either. Coconut and pineapple aren't my favorite but they're alright. 

I LOVE Versace Bright Crystal Absolu, it's my current fragrance. I also like the KVD Saint and Sinner perfumes, and I liked the Taylor Swift Enchanted fragrance. I also like the warm and cozy scent from VS Pink and the smell of cocoa butter. 

I usually wear a fruity smelling deodorant, right now it's the Secret nectarine solid one, and I use B&amp;BW Magic in the Air body wash (it says it's almond flower, white iris, and whipped vanilla scented), cocoa butter body oil, and cocoa and shea butter lotion. I also use Maui Moisture shea butter shampoo and coconut oil conditioner, as well as the Not Your Mother's Curl Talk foam and cream (plus the deep conditioner when I need it, they smell kinda fruity and floral, idk what I think they smell like but when I Googled it trying to find the notes people have said raspberry, grape candy, berry-ish, and ""like a drink with an umbrella in it"". The ingredients say it has shea butter and rice curl complex in it, but it also says it has parfum in it so idk what the notes of the fragrance they put in it are to give you a better idea of what it smells like. But the scent isn't super strong after my hair dries) and argan oil gel and hair oils. 

I've been eyeing the Kayali Juicy Apple perfume but I think it's sold out right now and idk if it's coming back, I think I would like it but I've never smelled it before. I love my VBC Absolu but just wondering what else the experts think I might like that would go well or better with the scents in my skin/haircare routine",2022-01-12 12:14:43

Perfumes,do all perfumes smell like perfume?,"hopefully im making sense but i recently bought a bottle of grass by gap eau de toilette online bc i heard that the original scent smelled like fresh cut grass and not similar to perfume at all. when it arrived earlier today it unfortunately smelled like every other perfume to me with some slight hints of green apple :( im really not a fan of that strong perfume smell and i wanted something natural, preferably very green, but im not sure where to even start looking. also, i know that this original scent was discontinued in the 90s and i've never actually smelled it before but i was really looking forward to wearing a perfume that didn't smell like perfume. does anyone know where i can find something similar to what im looking for?",2021-11-27 16:05:14

Perfumes,white florals that smell cold,"I'm looking for perfumes that have predominantly white floral notes and smell cold, i.e. that don't create a warm cozy feeling, but a fresh and ethereal kind of atmosphere around you. (Like a breeze in the spring)

I dislike very loud gourmand/fruity/vanilla/sweet fragrances - they make me feel like I'm suffocating. They are too warm for my taste.

Also, please don't recommend anything with too much patchouli or something spicy (ginger for example) - I seem to get a headache from these kinds of fragrances.

I'm also okay with powdery, citrusy and woody notes (if they are not too dominant).

Fragrances I really adore(d) are/(were):

- Pure Poison by Dior

- Omnia Crystalline EDP by Bvlgari (sadly discontinued)

- Gardenia EDT by Chanel (before the reformulation)

Perfumes,Best long-lasting perfume for men,"We all want our perfumes to last all day, to last for hours, and to stay on our skin all night. Some perfumes are light and only last 2-3 hours, others last so long that they become part of your clothes. Perfumes with a higher concentration usually last longer due to the fragrance oil inside the bottle. However, this does not always appear to be the case. The perfumes mentioned here are the longest-lasting regardless of their concentration to add to it, and they are also some of the [best Luxury perfumes](http://www.taifalemarat.com/en) for men.

**#1 Dior Sauvage** 

&amp;#x200B;

[Dior Sauvage ](https://preview.redd.it/ly26qv8qvi381.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63eaca177e21d300f4561d653a03d8ea67ed7296)

A fragrance already loved by many, which is also very popular. It earned a spot on this list for dropping it, and while it's just an Eau de Toilette, the fragrance is a beast. It has loud, vibrant bergamot at the top and a very citrusy scent. This perfume is made for all occasions and is known to please the crowd, however, this perfume is overused, so if you are trying to find a unique fragrance away from Dior Sauvage.

**#2 The King T-10** 

&amp;#x200B;

[The King T-10 ](https://preview.redd.it/rc6l31orvi381.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d951752f914034bb0f84f3a1e0d0c1a398c75f01)

With top notes of cardamom and pink pepper, you have a scent that leaves a trail every time you walk into a room, from Taif Al Emarat, The [best UAE perfume](https://taifalemarat.com/en/collections/taif-collection/2) that is so popular in the Middle East and for the right reasons. Middle Easterners like their fragrances to be very strong in general, so this one had to make this list due to its longevity and exposure throughout the day, and fortunately, this one isn't popular either. Luxurious Arabic perfume.

**#3 Acqua di Gio Profumo** 

&amp;#x200B;

[Acqua di Gio Profumo ](https://preview.redd.it/embu5gksvi381.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38d3fb4685fe7cdee98f6f5f5f91549d9a7b8dd7)

A stronger version of Acqua Di Gio, the best-selling men's fragrance, the DNA of this fragrance was much loved but unfortunately, it didn't last long enough. Therefore, perfumer Alberto Morillas decided to make a stronger version but this time he added incense as well, giving it a wonderful fragrance that is more deep and long, this fragrance is also all year round and also for all occasions. Definitely classic.

**#4 Dashing T-04** 

&amp;#x200B;

[Dashing T-04 ](https://preview.redd.it/hty5fmauvi381.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e97ccb9b74f3e5284d7dd729a12ba01a43e6c0f)

Here we have another perfume from Taif Al Emarat because the brand is very popular in the Middle East, and most of its perfumes are very strong and clear. The scent of the perfume contains honey and also a very prominent oud which brings the fragrance more and more complete. Sweet and tempting scent.

\#5 Versace Dylan blue 

&amp;#x200B;

[Versace Dylan blue ](https://preview.redd.it/0u74mhbvvi381.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72124f88f6cb57f503da043d7be5c23aac6c272c)

&amp;#x200B;

A true Versace masterpiece, it mostly contains fresh notes that are perfect for keeping you smelling fresh all day long. The complimenting factor of this perfume is great too, you can wear this perfume almost everywhere but it is also very popular so if you want something that is not normally found in every man's perfume collection, you may want to look elsewhere.

I really love the look of the bottle of Moonlight so want to get it but its a bit too rich and gourmand of a scent for me. I would like to find something to cut through that sweetness and lighten it up, perhaps with a fruity/floral perfume or mist. If you have any recommendations please let me know. Thanks :)",2021-12-05 11:01:11

Perfumes,"How to tell a fake, and perfume advice.","Good evening everyone. 
I am looking to purchase my partner some perfume. I was browsing online and found someone selling a brand new, sealed ‚ÄúTom Ford, Neroli Portofino‚Äù 100ml for way less  than the next closest seller. 
Is there anyway to tell if this is a fake, as it still costs a decent amount. 
Secondly, does anyone have any opinions regarding this perfume? I am trying to decide between the ‚ÄúTom ford‚Äù OR ‚ÄúVanille De Madagascar by Chopard‚Äù. 
I am not uncultured, but when it comes to ladies perfume I am‚Ä¶less than educated on this topic.

**What makes a perfume romantic?**

What makes a scent romantic? Flowers are usually associated with love and romance, so many popular perfumes combine scents of rose, jasmine, lavender, or other freshly cut flowers. Oriental or amber fragrances also commonly appear in romantic fragrances such as woody notes, musk, or vanilla.

**How do you know that the smell is strong?**

Usually, the intensity of the smell is less than the name of the fragrance on the bottle. The concentration of the scent indicates the strength that the fragrance possesses. Perfumes with a higher aroma concentration contain more perfume oils and less alcohol.

**How do I find my signature scent?**

Giving yourself a chance to truly appreciate if you are going to enjoy a fragrance is a key to getting your signature fragrance. ""Allow yourself time to truly experience the entire fragrance, from the top notes you smell immediately, to the deeper, long-lasting base notes.

**Does wearing perfume make you more attractive?**

Perfume can make you more beautiful: Scientists find that beautiful scents make women's faces more attractive. Researchers have noticed that a woman's appearance becomes more attractive when she smells good. They say smells can change the way we perceive attraction and perceive each other.

**Should you be sporting multiple fragrances?**

If you combine different tones of different perfumes, it can lead to a headache. Hence, apply two or more favorite perfumes to form an identity. You can get creative while mixing your fragrances, but the best way is to stay in the same family as woods, florals, fresh, and citrus because they can bond strongly with each other.

In short, there is a level of fragrances for women and men only. However, perfumes do not have a specific gender, because there are women's perfumes that appeal to men and vice versa; There are also various fragrances that allow you to refine both sexes.

**Are perfumes unisex?**

Technically, all scents are recognizable as unisex,‚Äù says Maria Norrislamova, CEO and co-founder of Scent bird. However, brands typically market heavy fruit or floral fragrances as feminine, while stronger scents such as woody Leather and spices are considered masculine.",2021-12-05 16:04:01

Perfumes,Need help getting new perfume for my wife,"Over the passed 3 years I have bought my wife 2 perfumes; Si Passione - Giorgio Armani and Garden - D&amp;G. She absolutely loves both.

In all honesty, I have no idea how to choose a perfume, nor do I really know my wife's favorite scent. The Si perfume I chose randomly and just hoped she would like it. I actually bought it in advance, and while shopping together a few days later went to a store to get a sample and made her smell it just by the way to see her reaction. Fortunately, she liked it. The D&amp;G I kind of got a clue from my mother in law that my wife liked it.

Both of them are almost finished and I would like to buy her something new.

Any suggestions?",2021-12-06 06:43:02

Perfumes,Looking for alternatives to Eau de Narcisse Bleu / Vettiveru,"Hi everyone, 

Does anyone has suggestions on both of this perfumes?

I'm fascinated by Hermes' Eau de Narcisse Bleu because it reminds me this peculiar childhood smell of not a freshly watered garden, but of  water sprinkled flowers. I would buy it again but for the price, I'm looking for something that lasts longer than this cologne series, which imo is appalling.

With Comme des Garcons Vettiveru I have the same issue, I know it's a cologne and I love it,  but it just disappears after 15-20 minutes. I have a few other vetivers in my wardrobe (Guerlain, Lalique, Hermes) but they do not have this fresh, ''forest soil after autum's rain'' note that Vettiveru has.  


Thanks in advance for your suggestions.",2021-12-08 02:51:29

There‚Äôs 3 others in this ‚Äúset‚Äù of fragrances. They can stack on top of each other and supposedly mingle well together. I bought 3 of them and the 1 is going back.

Perfumes,"Zoologist ""Moth"" review","Moth is a powdery resin fragrance with a twist. Soft but complex. First spray is a very powdery amber/resin, reminiscent of your grandma's perfumes from the 80's/90's. Give it a minute and the myriad of other notes come waltzing in, one by one. Honey, nutmeg, saffron and soft iris are noticeable in the beginning. This fragrance feels soft but chaotic, there is so much going on your nose goes into overdrive trying to settle on any dominant notes. I suppose it's reminiscent of a soft moth haphazardly fluttering towards a light source, so Zoologist have done a great job capturing the essence of a moth in that regard.

Half an hour in, it's a lightly sweetened version of the opening. Soft powdery resin with some deep spices. A light musky rose and a powdery yellow mimosa floral note can be noticed. There is a shadow of honey that comes and goes. At the six hour mark, it's a light powder which reminds me of a dusty old closet. Moth balls come to mind here.

It actually feels pretty spot on in terms of it being a scent example of a moth, with the dustiness, the old fashioned amber and the spices. It ventures a bit too far into art fragrance territory for me to want to wear it outside the house, but it is an amazing art fragrance at that. It would suit those who prefer powdery or moody fragrances.",2021-12-10 18:40:06

Perfumes,4 okay perfumes or 1 designer perfume?,"Help, I was planning to buy some fragrances next week. But here‚Äôs the thing, I‚Äôve been thinking if I should buy like 3-4 Zara perfumes I‚Äôd like the most OR if I should buy 1 designer perfume (particularly Dior Hypnotic Poison). I know Zara perfumes don‚Äôt last very long but they‚Äôre very afforadable. Some people say they last like a good 2-4 hours ish on them. BUT the problem is if I only buy Hypnotic Poison, though it smells amazing and has insane longevity and projection, I can‚Äôt use it for every season and occassion. However, If I buy 3-4 Zara perfumes, I‚Äôll have one for every season or for a certain mood and occassion (but doesnt last that long.) Soooo, what do you think? What would you do if it were you?

Perfumes,Best Perfumes Brand for Men and Women in Pakistan," A good perfume is an important element in maintaining beauty for all Pakistani men and women, as a pleasant fragrance creates a lasting feeling. Shops and online stores are full of various deodorants, perfumes, and sprays. However, a good smell should be pleasant, long-lasting, and not too heavy for the pocket. Many Pakistani brands have offered beautiful perfumes in beautiful packaging in recent years. Here is an overview of the cheapest, original, and [best perfumes for men in Pakistan](https://www.buyrawaha.com/product-category/men/) with the [best fragrance from Pakistani brands](https://www.buyrawaha.com/). 

 

There is something special about [best perfumes in Pakistan](https://www.buyrawaha.com/). Not only do they express our personality, but they also tell us a lot about our choices. With several celebrities churning, branded, and non-branded perfumes in Pakistan are storming the racks, it becomes difficult to choose just one.

In addition, getting a good, long-lasting scent is a big struggle, especially if you have a low budget. But we have already got the list of best [original perfumes in Pakistan](https://www.buyrawaha.com/product-category/new-arrival/) that smell good, which are not too expensive and are available in Pakistan. Take a look at them!

You may wonder why I have put the [Rawaha Perfumes](https://www.buyrawaha.com/) on top, while many branded and well-known [perfumes in Pakistan](https://www.buyrawaha.com/) are trending. Let me tell you why!

From the beginning, Rawaha‚Äôs production of perfumes has been above average. In addition, it is always sold in the same quantity and is popular among the people of Pakistan.

One of the [best perfumes for women in Pakistan](https://www.buyrawaha.com/product-category/women/) is the [Rawaha fragrance](https://www.buyrawaha.com/). They contain a variety of natural scents. The vibe in these perfumes is unique that is not like the rest.

These perfumes are of kind and masterpieces and are made with great care by using hand-selected ingredients in various magical combinations.

&amp;#x200B;

[the wise](https://preview.redd.it/u5izemcmvv581.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e99d7a78fa0793f6072f5c9e5376f8d755baf360)

 

n addition to creating a unique and popular floral scent, [Rawaha](https://www.buyrawaha.com/) is also famous for creating an amazing fragrance. Fortunately, their prices are also in the range of 1200‚Äì5000 PKR that is very affordable considering the quality.

**WB by Hemani**

&amp;#x200B;

[wb by hemani](https://preview.redd.it/fc2u3pkpvv581.jpg?width=415&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86c76acd9773fbed8360963e145ae49ed71d6bce)

 

[Wasim Badami by Hemani](https://wbhemani.com/fragrance) is a great brand that offers more than just perfume. Interestingly, the perfume and body lotions are very hot and strong and ensure quality. Personally, I have used the scent of this brand, and I like them.

Light mist with persistent odor and aroma on the body; you will find it all under one roof. Dynasty is also my favorite, and it is priced at (PKR 2350). The amazing thing is that there are explosive floral mixed with the smell of caramel and are very sparkling.

**Saeed Ghani**

&amp;#x200B;

[saeedghani](https://preview.redd.it/t4xt6p8tvv581.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38fde53a7e7e8b9826683df0cd82d24900000546)

 

[Saeed Ghani](https://saeedghani.pk/collections/fragrances) has been specialising in perfumes and skincare products since 1888. Additionally, what interests me the most is how they create cute, pocket-sized attar from renowned global perfumes! For example, you can get a special scent by mixing your favourite notes or fragrances.

You can get 212 Sexy and Chanel no.5 in the form of attar. They are oil-based, not alcohol. Want to know the price? Only 500 PKR! It‚Äôs really low.

In addition, they have their own perfume packaging, and you can pay extra to have the perfume in the perfume bottle.

**Our Pick**

This would probably be [Rawaha](https://www.buyrawaha.com/), as it is committed to the quality and ideology of customer service that represents the best retailers across Pakistan.",2021-12-16 18:44:35

Perfumes,Perfume to use after the pool swimming (for the men),"Hi,

Recently, I started swimming in the public swimming pool. After the morning swimming session in the pool, I usually go to work, where I work in fintech.

&amp;#x200B;

The water in the pool (and the one in the showers) is heavily chlorinated. I smell chlorine after every shower. I tried various perfumes, but I was not satisfied with the results. Recently I sprayed Tokyo by Kenzo and I have to admit that it turned out to be quite an interesting fragrance marriage.

I was wondering what you guys know about the age of a perfume and its performance.
I recently bought a 50ml bottle of tom ford tobacco oud with a batch code that can be traced back to a manufacturing date in 2017. Performance is quite disappointing when comparing to the sampler in my local perfumery. The scent becomes almost undetectable after ca 3h to my nose.

I can't remember any text on the bottle but I'm sure there was, maybe in black? 
My mom seems to remember the name of the perfume being ""Tommy Boy"" could it have been an old bottle of Tommy Hilfiger Tommy Boy? I don't know because anytime I look up 'Tommy Boy' I get new pictures of the fragrance. The shape of the bottle was oval-ish. 

The scent was floral and zesty and sporty. Idk if it was a limited edition? I believe it may have been unisex.

Perfumes,Chanel No.19 Poudre vs. Prada Infusion D'Iris,Hello everyone! I tested and fell in love with Chanel No.19 Poudre and want to get a FB.

I am the biggest fan of Chanel and No.19 Poudre is not very long lasting but it still doesn't perform worse than Omnia Crystalline for example. I love the iris and green notes it smells like real florist shop and has feminine touch to it with that powderiness. Is Prada really better? If it has unisex feel I would stay away from it. I can't even see it at the local perfumery to test. I have been looking foe green perfume for years...

So lets say I tried creating a formula like this myself using absolute and essential oils, would it be possible? And what chemicals or natural oils would be similar to the smell of semen?

I think I'd also throw in a bit of red wine, tobacco, chocolate and authentic deer musk to spice things up further.

I think the first ingredient would have to be salt. Because semen is quite salty. But there obviously needs to be something more. Chlorine perhaps? How would you go about finding the ingredients? And how would you formulate this ""sexiness in a bottle""?",2021-11-25 14:46:39

Study shows the way we perceive certain scents is heavily dependent on our emotions, for example, if you smelt a [Luxury](http://www.ramasat.com/en) Dubai Perfume on a day where you are very excited and overall happy you would most likely find yourself feeling excited and happy the next time that same scent were to enter your nostrils, however, if you had the first encounter with that same perfume on a day where you‚Äôve gotten fired from your job you might not be so eager to smell that Luxury perfume again this is because our sense of smell is very much connected to our memory and emotions. Put it this way if you love how something smells, you also love how it makes you feel.

Perfumes,Need help deciding on a perfume!,"26F in the Midwest. I'm pretty new to the world of perfumes. I'm looking for a good year round, everyday perfume, or a good spring/ summer one and fall/winter one, and one for my wedding next summer. For years the only fragrances I've bought have come from Bath &amp; Bodyworks or Victoria's Secret, and I'm looking for something a little more mature. My favorites have been B&amp;BW Forever Red (love the warmth but sometimes gives me a headache), B&amp;BW Golden Pineapple Luau for summer, VS Pure Seduction (my fiance loves this one but sometimes it comes off too sharp to me?) and VS Eau So Sexy (I love the apple and cream scents in this! Might be too sweet after a while though?). I liked VS Bombshell too but it's my sister's signature scent. I've looked through ScentBird and my first delivery was Juicy Couture Viva la Juicy Noir which I really enjoy, but it's not strong enough and barely lasts an hour on me. 

I've been thinking I want something fruity and fresh but with warm undertones. I also like the idea of clean, fresh scents, like what I'm hearing D&amp;G Light Blue must be. I don't like powdery scents or patchouli, and not sure but don't think I like musk either. My favorite scents I know for sure are: apple, caramel, vanilla, honeysuckle, peach, pineapple. Not sure what flower scents I like but do know I'm not a fan of strong rose scent in perfumes. I don't want something too overwhelming but that lasts for a while and is able to smelled when I walk past someone. 

I got a couple samples of some Imaginary Author's scents and so far really like Whiff of Waffle Cone as it smells like a good burnt caramel to me, but too warm for warm weather. I've been wearing Yesterday Haze for a couple hours now and am really liking it as well, but it might have to grow on me a bit still.  I have Sundrunk and Cape Heartache I still need to try, but from the bottle, Cape Heartache is like fake Christmas tree and strawberry to me, so I'm a little nervous for that one. 

ScentBird recommendations that I'm maybe interested in: D&amp;G Light Blue (from what I read you really can't go wrong with this?), Michel Germain Sexual Noir, DKNY Be Delicious, Vince Camuto Illuminare Intensa, Clinique Happy, Confessions of a Rebel Get a Room, Burberry Brit, Burberry Brit Sheer, D&amp;G Pour Femme, Marc Jacobs Daisy Eau So Fresh, Kenzie So Pretty, D&amp;G L'Imperatrice 3, and J'ador Dior.  Someone suggested La Vie Est Belle and I got a tiny sample of it --haven't worn it yet but a sniff from the bottle smells too mature/powdery for me.  

I hope some of this helps and isn't too much! I'd love to find my signature fragrance. Thanks for any suggestions or opinions!",2021-09-28 08:29:45

 ""Its initial intensive and energetic chord of citruses merges with an apple freshly plucked from the tree and precious kumquat.

the start was really masculine and woody, but only woody. i believe it was sandalwood and maybe rose(?). then you would smell a little musk then the flowery notes would come to your nose. the perfume was nearly unisex and not because of our body chemistry.

Perfumes,How to Wear Perfume and Make it Last Longer,"Applying perfume in the right way will help you make your presentation more effective. Wearing a good fragrance is a great confidence booster. If you are looking to buy good scents, choosing original perfume online in the UAE is the best choice.

There are many different ways to apply perfumes, you can quickly master the art of using perfumes when knowing the right ways of it. To buy your favorite scents, you can choose Samawa and remain fragrant throughout the day.

**Here are some tips which can help**

1. The perfect time to apply your perfume is after a shower. After taking a bath, you need to gently towel your skin and spray the scent to your pulse points. In this way, the pores will soak up the smell and leave your skin smelling nice all day long.

2. You need to moisturize your skin so that it can absorb the scent. Moisturizing your body will also protect your skin from the irritation caused by the alcohol present in your perfume.

3. There are certain areas in your body where the veins are very close to the skin. Your body generates the most heat at your pulse points, and it can help intensify your fragrance and help amplify your scent.

4. Many people have the habit of instantly rubbing their wrists together after being sprayed on. Thus, you need to stop this habit as it breaks down the fragrance.

5. One can extend the lifespan of their fragrance by mixing it with unscented body lotion. You need to add a few sprays to the cream in your hand and then apply it to your body.",2021-10-06 13:53:51

I‚Äôm not saying Elixir is bad, but let‚Äôs get this right, it shouldn‚Äôt be priced anything more than say an EDP Sauvage!!! 

Smell is a decent 7 outta 10. Nothing mind blowing. A modern twist on an old school Lavender based masculine scent. Projection is decent for about 2 hrs within an arms length. Does leave a decent silage though. Longevity is 8-10 hrs.

I don't really like it when someone i know uses the same perfume as i do (that applies to lotions as well, anything related to scent). I always try my best to get my hands on perfumes that others aren't using. My birthday is coming up and i wanted to change my perfume. My boyfriend said he'll gift me the perfume as he's currently working somewhere they sell perfumes at discounted prices. We recently went out together with a friend and that's when he gave me the perfume. I really loved the perfume. After searching for so long i was so happy that i finally got one that i loved, that suited me and that didn't gave me a headache (I'm quite sensitive to scents). My friend who came with us smelled the perfume, she said she'll buy  a perfume as well since they're at discounted prices. We went to mado and she sniffed some perfumes and finally got one that she liked. She asked my boyfriend to get that one for her. Today i found out from my boyfriend that he got her the SAME perfume he got for me and guess what? I'm SO annoyed. At no point did she ask me if it was okay for her to get the same one as me and neither did my boyfriend gave me a heads up that the friend asked him to get the same one. I'm so annoyed at both of them (the friend does not know yet, only my boyfriend knows). Is my frustration justified? I get it that she probably didn't know that i wouldn't have liked it and my boyfriend says he didn't know that i like to keep my scent unique (i highly doubt that, we've been together for almost 4 years). I just want to know if my frustration is justified. I obviously want to give them the benefit of the doubt but can't help feeling frustrated.",2021-10-20 14:45:19

I do not have any body odor to begin with and initially thought it was my personal perception of not being able to smell the perfume after spraying it on but that has been confirmed by my bf as well. Once we tried on the same perfume (MyBurberry) and it lasted on him ! and both of us couldn't smell it on me. Is it just me?

Perfumes,Rose perfume with Dior Sauvage,"Hi! I have no clue about perfumes so please excuse my obscure description.

In november of 2016 I smelt a perfume, I am still looking for. The acquaintance who wore the perfume said it was Roses de Chloe. I now wear that scent a lot since I like it very much. I suppose I like rose scented perfumes in general.

I can imagine that the perfume I smelt in 2016 was rose scented. However it did have a very distinct note that I can't recognize in Roses de Chloe. I regularly notice it in perfumes when passing by people on the street - equally often men and women, so I think it's a ""unisex"" scent that is used frequently. I would describe it as deep, down-to-earth, even magical because the smell of it makes me so happy instantly although I don't have any memories of it that I know about. Maybe it's wood?

I smelt quite a few perfume testers but I never recognized the smell or rather that one note (maybe it's not just a note, but a combination that smells so distinct to me, but I don't think so). I did definitely smell it yesterday in Dior's Sauvage. I recognized the smell on the items around the perfume (I think a little bit got onto the surrounding make up brushes) and after I sprayed it on my wrist, I wouldn't have been able to identify it from just smelling the perfume bottle and having too much of it in my nose.

If you have any idea what I could be talking about, I'd be very happy to hear your suggestions :)",2021-10-24 02:33:43

Perfumes,New to perfume‚Ä¶,"Hi I am new to perfume and the world of different scents, I have a pretty beginnery kinda collection mostly comprised of cheaper scents like Ariana Grandes line but have been looking at higher end perfumes and have got a few more luxurious perfumes(to me) like Armani My Way but besides the point I was wondering if my collection is ok where it is, I have been researching a list of things to do with perfume but didn‚Äôt even notice that they are somewhat in the sunlight. I live in the U.K. and it‚Äôs not terribly sunny however I was wondering if I should plan on moving my collection as although the are in the sunlight, they are a couple of meters away from the window and I am unsure if it would be necessary to move my things around just so they done get ruined. However all the articles I have read haven‚Äôt been as clear as to where or how much light they could be exposed to, one article said ‚Äúnot on windowsill or radiators‚Äù however they are on some shelves across from the radiator and window so are they ok where they are or should I look into moving them or at least getting a little cabinet for them ??

The only description the perfume has is ""An exotic oriental scent wrapped in a luxurious bouquet of florals"", and though the perfume is called Jeweled Amber, I'm not sure amber is part of the notes, considering other perfumes in this line were called Sapphire Rain and Sweet Amethyst, so it could just refer to the stone.",2021-08-29 06:00:00

Perfumes,Recommendation for a long-lasting perfume?,"Hello! I‚Äôm looking to get a new every-day perfume!

I‚Äôm almost done with Born in Roma (by Valentino) and I love it so much but the only problem is that it doesn‚Äôt seem to last long :/
I hate buying expensing perfume and having it not last long :/ after a few hours of wearing the Born in Roma one, I barely even smell it and always have to re-apply (I keep a sample in my purse!)
  

Does anyone have any recommendations for perfumes that you have worn that tend to last long?

I like scents that are more warm &amp; spicy, floral, I especially like ones with jasmine or orange notes! 

Some of the fragrances I have stuck with for a long time are:
Valentino - born in Roma 
Viktor&amp;Rolf - Flowerbomb 
YSL - Black Opium
Giorgio Armani - S√¨

My current go to's are D&amp;G Pour Femme Intense and Killian Love Don‚Äôt Be Shy, which I think smells similar to each other.

What is similar? Doesn't have to be identical, just the same sort of 'theme' of scent - not too sweet, musky, citrus, unusual, almost spicy in some way - simply delicious as far as I'm concerned haha.

Perfumes,"Where are these unknown, expensive perfumes coming from?","Silly question but I don't know how to word it. For my birthday, my boyfriend went to a perfume store. He got gizella by gabriella antosh, and Etoile by Claude marsal.

I have always loved an expensive perfume. It was suggested as a nice birthday gift. I have only shopped at department store with common name brands.

He came home with these and they smell awesome! He told me one was retailed 175. I scoffed bc even chanel is not not that expensive.

I Googled them bc I was convinced the man was not telling the truth, and the first one retails at 175. The second one retails at 250.

I Googled these perfumes to see what people said about them, and there are no reviews on any of them. There are no results about these. Odd little Facebook page here with like 175 likes and an Instagram page.

So who are these companies in general? Why do they charge so much? Why are there no reviews out there?

Perfumes,My skin vastly changes every perfume I try,"I've tried dozens of perfumes, and I use Fragrantica and other websites to get an idea of a scent profile before I purchase samples or bottles.

But there's a problem. My skin (and hair), for some reason, change every single perfume. It knocks out top notes completely and goes straight for a linear base note scent. Usually it's the exact opposite of what I'm looking for, which is frustrating.

I've tried moisturizing beforehand to see if hydration is an issue. No difference.

A few examples: 

* Yawahawda J-Scent attracted my attention for it's top fruit notes, its lactonic and green sweetness, etc. On me, it's straight baby powder and amber, nothing else.
* A snagged a sample of Princess by Kilian, excited for a sweet fruit scent. Instead it's heavy lemon benzoin, nothing else.
* Anything with citrus or florals ends up smelling like bathroom cleaner or a stinky bouquet, respectively. Always headache-inducing.

I just want to know more or less what to expect when I test a new perfume - not for every test bottle to be a shot in the dark. Does anyone else have this problem? Any advice or insight? It it possible that my skin just sucks for perfume? Thanks in advance.",2021-08-31 14:59:13

Perfumes,Finding the right scent,"Hello! I basically needed advice on finding the right perfume for me. I‚Äôve been searching for about a year and when I smell a certain perfume it smells amazing but never just right when I wear it. I just assumed that it was mixing with my natural chemistry and continued the search. Well I tried Libre by Dua Lipa fell in love with the scent and took home a sample. The first day wearing the spray I loved how it smelled on me and I was finally through with the search. The second day I sprayed this scent on me it immediately smelt different. I decided it was due to the packaging and maybe it didn‚Äôt keep well in the sample container. Well then recently I ordered a sample of vanilla vibes which is not the type of scent I usually go for. And the moment I sprayed this on me i fell absolutely in love. The smell lingered perfectly the whole day and I was so satisfied. The next day when I spray the same amount on the same spot, I could only smell that same type of scent that came from wearing Libre. To me it‚Äôs like a burnt smell. Very hard to ignore. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just the way it mixes with my natural faramones but I‚Äôve tried spraying on my clothes rather than skin but the same results. Are they any recommendations for something that will mix with my natural scent or a way to keep perfumes from mixing with my scent?

Perfumes,Gucci Flora Gorgeous Gardenia doesn't last and I need help about it!,"Hello everyone!  


I have an issue and I would love to hear from you if you are having the same issue.

I bought ""Flora Gorgeous Gardenia"" perfume from a Gucci boutique last week (new bottle not the old one). A week before my purchase I tried the tester in the store and it lasted for a long time. However, since my purchase I used the perfume for four times and it doesn't even last for a minute. I tried spraying it normally to my neck   then I tried a different approach by spraying on my wrists, behind ears and even to my hair according to tips I got from other people. It didn't last.

I thought it might be something related to my skin but I heard some other buyers having the same issue. I contacted the store about the situation but they couldn't give me a definite answer about is there anything I can do about the situation ( like return it, exchange it ). They will give me a call about it but before that I wanted to ask you all whether you had a situation like this and what is the procedure/ process of Gucci in these kind of situation?

Also, if I hear a negative response do you have any tips on how can I make the perfume last? I feel like I am spraying for nothing!

Thank you so much!",2021-09-10 05:57:45

I am excited about this launch because I get to create wonderful perfumes especially for those with sensitive noses and allergies!

I am a trained chemist with a master's degree in organic chemistry and have been making perfumes for myself and my friends for a few years. I started doing this because I have allergies to most commercial perfumes. My perfumes use essential oils with low  Ogren Plant Allergy Scale scores, ( see Orgren's book on Amazon) unless otherwise noted.  So ask me questions and check out my fledgling startup. We will add more products through the fall. Thanks!",2021-09-14 07:10:31

The fresh aroma of sea waves crashing on the coast, the woody fragrance of the dense forests and a hint of fruitiness with the scent of apples. This exquisite fragrance, the Hugo Boss Green is made for those men who live life by their own terms and are untamed.

Bob Aliano created this cologne with an eclectic combination of fragrances of Green Apple, Carnation and Cedar. This daily use fragrance contains top notes of Mint, Basil and Apple, which then leads to a floral fresh heart note of Carnation and Sage. It finishes off with a lingering masculine scent of patchouli, fir and cedar.

Perfumes,Perfume Parlour Review,"
This post is strictly my opinion and I have paid for all these fragrances out of my own pocket. I only order the sprays, unless I‚Äôve stated otherwise, as I find them to be the easiest to use and they perform more like the original than the oils. When I first get an order in I leave the fragrances in the fridge for two to three weeks to macerate before I review them or wear them properly. 

These reviews take a lot of time and effort to write up, if you would like to order from PP I would appreciate it if you signed up with my link below. You get **10% off** and I get a little kickback also: 
https://www.perfume-parlour.co.uk/login/=64924




**Card Red Surplus 1850 - MFK, Baccarat Rouge 540 Extrait de Parfum**


In my last order I got the non-extrait version of BR540 (Card Red) and really liked it. I read that this was a l more popular version and a bit deeper and denser than the normal Card Red. 

The opening is minty cotton candy as the original and the non extrait however I get a bitter smell coming through also, I‚Äôm guessing this to be the bitter almond but I‚Äôm not too sure since I haven‚Äôt smelled the original. 
In the dry down I find this to have more musk and overall this has more animalic profile compared to the normal Card Red. 

The performance and projection are excellent, projecting well for over two hours and lasting on my skin for 6-7 hours in total. To be honest I think I prefer the normal Card Red rather than this but still it‚Äôs a nice fragrance. 


**Overall: 7/10**




**Avalanche Rouge 0746 - Aventus &amp; Baccarat Rouge 540 fusion**


A fusion of Creed Aventus and BR540, wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect since this is the first fusion I bought from PP but I wasn‚Äôt surprised that I really liked this fragrance. I‚Äôm a fan of PP‚Äôs interpretation of Aventus and BR540 separately so of course I really enjoyed this fusion. 

The opening is more BR540 than Aventus, it has that minty cotton candy opening but after a few minutes you start getting the fruity pineapple and bergamot notes of Aventus coming through. The dry down is more Aventus rather than BR540 but you still get a hint of that burnt latex throughout mixed with very slight woody and smoky notes in the later stages. 

Projection is good but not great at around 1 feet and I was expecting beast performance but it‚Äôs okay at around 5 hours. 

Overall a good scent, it is exactly what you‚Äôd expect if you‚Äôve smelled both frags. 


**Overall: 7.2/10**




**Avalanche Fruity 0022 - Creed Aventus**

As the name suggests this opens with very fruity notes of black currant, bergamot and pineapple. The opening isn‚Äôt as bright or photo realistic as the OG nor is it as woody or refined as Avalanche Woody (another, more expensive, PP Aventus clone). The dry down remains fruity and bright throughout with very little woody or smoky. Overall the fragrance doesn‚Äôt develop much but has that Aventus DNA throughout. 

Projection is good at around 1.5 feet for the first hour then dies down shortly after. Performance otherwise is good, this lasts around 6 hours on my skin. This is a good scent however there are better Aventus clones available, namely CDNIM or even Avalanche Woody. 


**Overall: 6.8/10**




**Mirror 0647 - Amouage Reflection Man**


A floral but clean and soapy opening, this reminds me of Prada L‚ÄôHomme but with a more Middle Eastern twist. The fragrance opens with rosemary and pink pepper notes in the beginning giving a flowery sweet smell that still remains masculine. In the dry down you still get the floral sweet smell but the orris root and neroli add a clean and powdery element. In the much later stages the fragrance stays the same but you get more sandalwood but it still keeps that floral powdery smell throughout. Overall a very easy to wear clean and safe fragrance. 

Projection is good at 2 feet and performance was above average lasting all day on my skin, starting to die down by the 8 hour mark. 


**Overall: 7.6/10**




**Intensely Scented 1919 - Maison Francis Kurkdijan, Amyris Homme**


The opening reminds me of TF Neroli Portofino but less citrusy overall. The opening is very bright with fresh mandarin and rosemary. It has a clean and realistic smelling mandarin and instantly has beastly projection on my skin. You can continue to smell the mandarin in the dry down also. The dry down remains fresh and bright but you get some iris and a slight hint of coconut however I don‚Äôt smell any chocolate or coffee. In the later stages I get some hints of tonka and very faint depth with oud but mainly tonka. Overall this is a nice fresh but uninspired fragrance with not much depth. I think this would be hard to dislike and a very safe everyday scent. 

The projection is great at a good 1.5 feet for about an hour and I could smell this on my self throughout the day. The performance is also good at 5-6 hours. 
This is definitely going in my next PP haul!


**Overall: 8/10**




**Prominent 1799 - Tiziana Terenzi, Orion**


Straight away I can tell this is an Aventus inspired fragrance, this opens with a strong note of pineapple, bergamot and fresh fruity notes. I get a lot of woody notes come through after 10-15 minutes and this is what I imagine the ‚Äúoriginal smoky woody‚Äù batch of Aventus to smell like. The dry down is more similar to Montblanc Explorer with strong notes of bergamot and slight notes of incense too. 

I don‚Äôt have the original Orion to compare this to but from what I‚Äôve read the original is very similar to Aventus, as is this PP clone. 

The projection is good at around 2 feet for around 2 hours and performance is 6 hours before I couldn‚Äôt smell it anymore. 

Overall this is a nice fragrance; another Aventus inspired fragrance but this PP perfume smells high quality and has good performance overall. My only complaint would be that this perfume applies quite oily, I know a lot of PP sprays are oily however this is the only one I used which I could actually see 


**Overall: 7.3/10**




**Saintly S 1804- By Kilian, Angel‚Äôs Share**


The opening reminds me of Dior F√®ve D√©licieuse, I don‚Äôt get much alcoholic/cognac but a lot of tonka bean and some oak. I start smelling the dry down quite quickly too around 15 minutes in and it‚Äôs very strong praline and vanilla with a hint of sandalwood. This is a very gourmand, designer smelling fragrance and reminds me a lot of F√®ve D√©licieuse throughout. 

Unfortunately I haven‚Äôt smelled the original so can‚Äôt comment on how close it is but the projection is decent at around 1-2 feet but performance could be improved, I could smell it on my skin faintly after 5 hours. 

Overall a nice unisex designer smelling fragrance but nothing to write home about. 


**Overall: 7.2/10** 




**Glazy Flower 1805 - By Kilian, Roses on Ice**


I received a free sample of this in my last PP order and fell in love with it so I had to purchase a 30ml bottle to give it a proper wearing and of course this smells the same as the sample I received in the my last order. 

This has one of the nicest openings I‚Äôve smelled, it‚Äôs a very balanced and fresh opening with a cocktail of cucumber, lime and juniper berries. The juniper berries remind me a lot of YSL Y EDP, which is my favourite fragrance and give the fragrance a very mass-appealing blue smell.

The dry down keeps the fresh aquatic smell but adds some rose and sandalwood. The rose is very faint and I get slight whiffs of it as well as faint smells of gin. Unlike other rose scents this isn‚Äôt heavy or leathery and sweet but fresh, clean and this smells very designer. This is a unisex fragrance and I think it‚Äôll be greatly suited for a very hot summer day.

This is quite a generic scent and has an oceanic and aquatic smell to it - similar to Acqua Di Gio. I find it really pleasant however I understand this is quite different to what By Killian normally do. 

The performance is good but not great. The projection is good for the hour but this quickly fades after. This still leaves a great scent trail for about 4 hours and I can still smell it faintly on myself around the 6 hour mark. 


**Overall: 8.5/10**

Point is, I can sometimes smell perfume because it's chemical and not natural. Even if I can't smell it, psychologically, I like to wear it (not sure why).

There's no point in me going to a perfume store, because my nose would just get overwhelmed and I wouldn't be able to smell anything, but what kinds of scents would you recommend?

Perfumes,Gourmands with superior projection and sillage,"I‚Äôve posted before asking about vanilla fragrances, but as I‚Äôve sampled different vanilla-based gourmands, I‚Äôve noticed that staying power and just power are not as strong as other types of fragrance. the longest lasting fragrance I‚Äôve tried is l‚Äôeau dissey. And that‚Äôs not sweet or gourmand by any standard. 
I didn‚Äôt try every fragrance suggested last time. But I would very much like to find one that is represented in reviews as Very powerful and long lasting
Ideally, I would love to find a vanilla powerhouse to use with layered florals or even a deeper fragrance like armani‚Äôs Si with a much sweeter vanilla or gourmand base. 
As of now, I may have to layer a deeper musky floral with a standard vanilla body spray. 
I also love coconut and chocolate, caramel, toffee, etc. My ideal fragrance has cassis, caramel, vanilla, sandalwood, musk, and jasmine. Maybe ginger
I‚Äôve tried princess by killian and that is the dragon I‚Äôve been chasing for months. It lasts 5 minutes on me. Yet; it was a great deal more pricey than buying a ginger body spray and a vanilla body spray and using them at the same time

I recently tried Black Opium and liked it well enough but it is a little basic. I also tried Alien and loved it but I am curious about everyday wear.

Perfumes,Xarmony: Ienari (Unisex) Japanese cologne intended to make you smell like a samurai. Contains hinoki cypress and Japanese orchids.,"**r/xarmony Ienari: The orchid samurai shogun of Japan. He filled the palace with orchid blooms. It opens with undertones of cherry blossoms and purple orchid gardens. It also gives off a regal masculine scent but can be feminine. Closing with notes of Japanese Hinoki Cypress.**

Samurai would wear incense in their helmets for battle, To ward off spirits, or distract the enemy. The power of smell is something never to be underestimated. How would you swing your sword at something that relaxes you? Would it slightly alter your senses ü§î? Can this increase my chances of victory? Life is a battle. Will this help me win?

I came up with the concept during Covid19. I had only purchased one game in 2019. It was called Sekiro. The game featured a lone samurai fighting to save a child lord. It also had lots of flower petals, smoke, incense, powders, and wines. Running through temples etc. It gave an aesthetic to life around the samurai as opposed to only on the battlefield. 

I also kept remembering the ""samurai that smelled of sunflowers."" (Recurring theme in Samurai Champloo.) 

I decided that orchids held a deep mysterious presence. One that gave off the aura you would expect of a samurai. It has a certain air to it that says death might be on the horizon. Yet you are at peace with this. Or it is moreso that you know the death is your enemy and not your own.

After researching, I found Ienari. I found that Japan, to this day, has giant orchid gardens: mainly the preserved  gardens left by Ienari. The exact flower is called Neofinetia falcata. It was so beloved by him that feudal lords would attempt to impress him by delivering their own personal blooms of the powerful plant. He would sometimes give them their own estate... I assume he would expect them to cultivate on said estate.

Only samurai were permitted to grow the flower leading to the name ""samurai orchid."" It became a symbol of nobility. Wealth. A mark of fine art and class. Luxurious.

Exactly what I want in a bottle. Or what I want to give others in a bottle. A small vivid piece of high society set in matching time and tone for men and women alike.

Fun fact: In 2005 a rare variety of Neofinetia falcata,aka samurai orchid, sold for $70,000. They serve as living paintings. In some cases, more valuable and treasured than original ink manuscripts from the Edo period!",2021-08-06 00:37:29

I am currently looking for some new perfumes with gothic/vampire vibes. 

I have always liked woody smells, the smells of churches and pine, incense. Something that would be similar to a religious mass. I am also not against a perfume with a sweeter scent like notes of amber, opoponax, ""warmer"" smells.

Just to give you an idea, here is a list of perfume I have already in my collection that could match what I want :

\- *John Galliano EDP* \- **John Galliano**

\- *Crystal Noir* \- **Versace**

\- *Eau d'Iparie* \- **L'Occitane**

\- *Poison* \- **Dior**

\- *Reve d'Ossian* \- **Oriza Legrand** 

\- *Cardinal* \- **Heeley** (not the pepper note)

\- *L'heure Bleue* \- **Guerlain**

I wanted to add *Vitriol d'Oeillet* \- **Serge Lutens** and *Habit Rouge* \- **Guerlain** but quite too spicy for the smell I would like to buy. Also, one last thing, I am not trying to find something with oud or spices in it.

I know it's a long shot but does anyone have any pointers for figuring out something that smells similar? It's a common perfume I swear, as I've smelled the exact scent in other products before, but I just can't pin it. It's quite fruity but obviously describing smells is difficult so I won't go too much into detail. After a bit of digging around online it's supposedly a passion fruit, pear and freesia scent, but the pear and freesia perfume I have doesn't smell all that close to it.. Maybe the passion fruit is the missing ingredient there, but I honestly don't know!

If any of you folks have used this conditioner before and have any pointers please let me know! It seems to be a fairly common fragrance like I said, I've smelled it in other products and also I remember years and years ago my sister had a body spray that smelled exactly like it.

Perfumes,Perfume recs for a coastal/seaside sort of scent.,"Hi! I use perfume every day, though I'm not particularly knowledgeable about it in the way a lot of people on this sub probably are so apologies if I come across as clueless! 

That aside, I've never really had a set, signature perfume. I am only in my late teens so I've just been trying new things out, receiving various scents for Xmas and such. In the past I have worn kenzo world, paco robanne pure xs for her, and im just finishing up on my bottle of modern muse (my current perfume) 

I'm going to need to purchase another once I've finished with this bottle, and although all of the scents I've previously tried are pleasant, I have a specific sort of scent that I am after and need some help finding something similar to my ideas. If anybody could help, it would be much appreciated! 

I've searched for perfumes with coastal, ocean type of tones, however most suggestions seem to fit more into the concept of a summer breeze or a tropical beach with coconut and driftwood and such. 

To sort of put an image to the scent I'm after, think more along the lines of English seaside, stormy beach, rainfall, blue, fresh and unisex (not super strict on this, I dont mind if it is more of a feminine or masculine scent, so long as I dont smell of lynx aftershave haha). I'm a massive lover of the beach and coastline, particularly in stormy and colder rather. I also love rain. So basically, I'm trying to find a perfume that merges these things together. When I say a seaside scent, I want to steer clear of summer and sun and coconuts etc! 

Would be great if the perfume isn't a super niche brand to make getting a hold of it easier. I would need UK shipping if it is only available online too, which may be relevant. 

This is probably incredibly specific so I'm not expecting a ton of answers but thought it would be worth a shot! Thank you in advance and again, sorry for how niche this is.",2021-08-16 18:28:49

Sometimes these memories aren‚Äôt good either‚Ä¶ so I used to wear Dior Roses n Roses whenever I had a night out. Like I wore that scent a lot (half way done with a 100ml bottle).

Perfumes,Dupe for Vivieene Westwood 'boudoir' ?,"My sister received boudoir for one of her teenage birthdays some time in the early 00s and kept it in a cabinet in her room. Basically, she didn't use it and had it more so for display, and when I entered my teen years and she begun clearing out old possessions, she passed it onto me and told me I could do with it what I wanted. I used it all, despite its probable age, and was gutted to see that it has since been discontinued. I haven't used or thought about it in a few years now but something reminded me of it earlier today and now I would love to get my hands on something as similar as possible. I honestly think it is one of my favorite scents of all time and I've not smelt anything else even similar to it. 

If anybody knows of anything that smells as similar to boudoir as humanly possible, or better yet, if there is a way I can still get a hold of boudoir itself, it would be very much appreciated. There isn't any particular notes I like best from it, its just the whole thing as a combination. It is truly so divine (although probably too overpowering for some, understandably!) 

I've checked online but the sites that looked hopeful also ended up being out of stock too, so my guess is that it is just no longer being made.

Perfumes,"Looking for a light, lemon-lime soda-like scent","Several years ago, when I started working full-time in an environment that never seemed to be a comfortable temperature, I picked up a habit of wearing a perfume to sort of trick myself into feeling warmer or cooler than my actual environment. I had a favorite Etsy shop that sold rollerball perfume oils, and they had a lot of scents I loved. Unfortunately, the shop has since closed, and I‚Äôm looking for a replacement for one of their scents.  

I generally lean unapologetically toward warm perfumes: sweet, spicy, woody, etc. As a result, I have plenty of options for cooler temperatures. The air conditioner is broken in my workplace at the moment, though, and it‚Äôs making me realize just how better-suited for fall and winter my collection really is. Light Blue is pretty much my only truly warm-weather perfume, and it doesn‚Äôt *quite* scratch the itch I have.  

There were a few scents from this Etsy shop that I loved in warmer weather (and I‚Äôd welcome recommendations for any similar scents). My favorite was a light perfume that was based on ginger ale, blood orange, and lemon; it was basically like smelling of lemon-lime soda, and I‚Äôd have sworn it could actually help make the hot weather bearable. Another good one was strawberry, jasmine, sandalwood, and amber, which, while sweeter than the ginger ale perfume, was also quite light. The third was frangipani, lime, pineapple, and sea salt.  

If anyone has suggestions for similar perfumes, particularly a cool, sparkling, sweet citrus-y scent like the ginger ale-inspired perfume (which was Siren Soap‚Äôs Nixxie, on the off chance someone might recognize it), I‚Äôd be very grateful!",2021-08-25 11:39:43

Perfumes,"Looking for fragrances similar to Lush's ""Light Touch"" facial oil","I recently bought the Light Touch facial oil (not a perfume,but a moisturizer) from Lush and i'm obsesed with it's scent. The website says the fragrance of the oil is mostly geranium and lavender but on the ingredient list, a few others like Chamomile, Olibanum and Myrrh are mentioned, as well as one mysterious ""fragrance"" that leaves me wondering what goes on that makes this bar smell so pleasant.

My problem is i'm very inexperienced in the world of perfume and I can't recognize any of the fragrance notes that are in this product. I don't even know what geranium smells like, and i don't smell a lot of lavender in it. 

But i do know this solid oil smells kinda fruity and flowery, and very fresh it's almost child-like, nothing like the usual Lush spice. 

Does anyone with any knowledge or experience with this product and fragrances, recognize familiar scents or could suggest perfumes with a similar feel?

I went into the Zara on Kensington High Street earlier today to see if they had a particular perfume in stock because I wanted to test it out. They didn't have it but that's not why I'm posting this. I'm posting because while I was in the perfume section, I saw what looked like a new Jo Malone collection. I think there were five of them. They had the same bottle design as the rest of the Jo Malone ones except this time the caps were metallic gold and had a vertical corrugated effect. I assumed they were new because I'd never seen them before. I tested two of them. One that had ""Oud"" in the name. *Something* oud‚Ä¶ Everyday Oud? I can't quite remember.  The other one had a citrusy smell. Again, I don't remember the name, Only that the name included a note that appealed to me. If I had to guess, I'd probably say mandarin? The only name I do remember is of one of the ones I didn't test which I'm fairly certain was called ""Leather Jardin"".

I'm confused because out of curiosity about this new collection, I googled it but I couldn't find anything about it whatsoever. Not even any talk of any upcoming Zara Jo Malone fragrances. I also searched through Zara's existing fragrances on Fragrantica and couldn't find anything relevant.

I dont know if it's just me or what, but I dont like a lot of the colognes, perfumes, deodorant scents, body wash scents that are in stores or that people use. It's like people wear these scents just because they're told to, not because it actually smells good or they like it.  
I will literally go through a whole 30 foot aisle and smell each deodorant and body wash, and rarely I'll find one that smells good.  
The scents that I like are tropical scents, flowers, coconut, cinnamon and vanilla, root beer, &amp; probably many more. The best deodorant scent I've found so far is Old Spice-Oasis. And I havent found a good smelling body wash yet. I am a 27 year old straight man, but I have used female deodorants and female body washes before, just because they had a nice, sweet smell to them. And they werent way too musky like a lot of men's products are. I am willing to explore mens, unisex, and women's products.

Perfumes,"""Dupes"" for Chic by Celine Dion?","I'm looking for a better version (so ""dupes"" in quotes, but really the opposite) of this cheap-o drugstore perfume by Celine Dion. 

I think it's the white gardenia scent that i love so much - this one supposedly is watermelon and cucumber based, with the gardenia and then sandalwood and what not.

I've been buying and using it since I was a teenager (at least 10 years) and now its discontinued, although i can find it all over the internet. But, the bottle is also really difficult and awkward - not that big - and I have to buy it pretty much ""used"" nowadays, and it doesn't last that long which. Of course, it's cheap, and I've heard it referred to as ""alcoholly"" too, which i didn't notice but the more i think about it i kinda see that. 

So, anyway, i'm on the hunt for a better version of this. I just order some samples from a few recommendations i got like l'imperatrice by Dolce &amp; Gabbana, or Pacifica's Tahitian Gardenia and some others. 

And I love Marc Jacobs perfumes, but even those ones that have ""gardenia"" and are similar are still not quite what I'm looking for. 

So if anyone knows of a perfume that preferably smells *EXACTLY* like this one, i will love you for the rest of my life! 

I also found a website where you can create your own scent :) so I ordered something there - will see how it goes. But those are pretty limited as to what you can choose. Anyway, thanks in advance!",2021-07-11 08:46:17

Perfumes,Container Material for Perfume Storage," 

Hello

I require to store perfume for long duration. I have found a glass jar to store it, as I read glass is best to preserve the perfume. I also have found a small 8oz fuel tank for RC cars/planes, which would be much better for my application (due to venting cap and mounting). I am however worried that the plastic will degrade the perfume, which I read online. However, if it is meant to hold fuel, and neither the fuel nor tank degrades, would it be also bad for perfume? I am new to this industry and need some advice on perfume chemical composition and reaction with other materials. Thank you.",2021-07-14 05:43:39

Perfumes,On the hunt for some perfumes that my husband and I both like!,"Hi all,

My husband and I have been together since 2014.  Since that time, I was hunting for a perfume that he would like.  In the past, I've sported the usual suspects like D&amp;G light blue, a few Marc Jacobs scents, Clinique Happy, etc.  

Finally in 2017 (one year into our marriage), we found two scents that my husband liked.  Both were from Soma.  The first was  Oh My Gorgeous¬Æ Vibrant‚Ñ¢ Eau de Parfum Spray, which was described as a beautiful blend of delicate white flowers, lilac blossom and sparkling pink grapefruit wrapped with a finish of soft white musk.  The other was Oh My Gorgeous¬Æ Passionate‚Ñ¢ Eau de Parfum Spray, which had a bold and unforgettable blend of mandarin blossom, sheer gardenia and vanilla orchid layered with rich, sensuous amber and exotic patchouli flower.

Eureka, these scents were perfect!  They wore well on me and I received many compliments from them, including the highly-coveted ""Wow, you smell so amazing and sexy"" from Mr. Husband.  Score.  So naturally, Soma discontinued these well-loved scents, in spite of many pleas from women like me not to do so.   I managed to snag two bottles of the So Vibrant before they sold it entirely (of which I just opened one) but I only have one bottle of So Passionate.  I've been in a mad dash to find some replacement perfumes.

Through my searching, I have figured out that he prefers citrusy scents over berry scents, so Jo Malone and Burberry Her are out.   He doesn't like gourmand scents, though I do occasionally sport Montale Chocolate Greedy when I'm hanging with my girlfriends because we all like the scent.  

He does like Replica Under the Lemon Trees, so I'm going to grab a bottle of that.  He likes By The Fireplace as a seasonal holiday scent.  I already have that, so it works well.   He doesn't like Jazz Club, though his office smells like it right now because I had the sample turned the wrong way when I was spraying it.  Oops.   I got a Replica sample kit some time ago.  

Anyway, so far Under the Lemon Trees is my only consistent win, but it is very spring/summery.  So I'm wondering if anyone has anything that may match the profiles that I've already given or something else I could try.   I've thought about D&amp;G POUR FEMME, but wonder if the sweetness would be overpowering.  Gucci Guilty Pour Femme is another one I'm considering.  Thoughts?

I'm not nearly as picky, though I try to avoid anything with a strong floral scent because the floral notes tend to override anything else on my body.   I can go from 30 years old to your grandma with butterscotch discs in her purse from 1985 real quick, especially with rose scents.  

Maybe I'm asking for a perfume unicorn, but these seems like a good place to start.  I appreciate any suggestions!  Thanks!",2021-07-15 00:54:24

Perfumes,I want to talk about the first official perfume I created named Odinsleep. Please tell me what you think in the comments.,"Odinsleep: Ethereal Lush by r/xarmony

A fragrance derived from icy cold peppermint, tobacco and cis3hex (grass). I consider this to be my greatest creation. I have gone through at least 2 full size 100ml bottles of it already. I wear it every single day. It literally centers me in this world. As soon as it reaches my nose my world freezes. All is at peace. My ADHD mind takes a pause. It's like all of my synapses are finally communicating in perfect harmony. I am 30 and was diagnosed at the age of 5. In those 25 medicated years nothing ever made me feel more grounded and complete. I feel so calm and so peaceful. No anxiety. No stress. I can breathe! The air is no longer thin. The weight of the world has been lifted. A full reset and refresh. I feel this every single time. Your experience may vary. I knew when I made this it was right for my entire being. I only hope I can give this feeling to others.

It opens with a calming aura of silent snow fading into a strange indescribable correlation between grassy aromachemical cis-3-hexenal and coumarin. The final touch of vanillin with a blend of tobaccos makes this fragrance stand apart from the rest.

""It feels like the world has stopped. A relaxing moment in time. Like a viking smoking pipe  tobacco in the empty halls of Valhalla.""

A viking returns home from a long journey to find there is not a soul around. He knows not what has become of his people, thus is the mystery. He sits beside a fire in what he once called home and lights his tobacco pipe. A one eyed raven flying overhead drops dried herbs into the fire. This exact moment. This exact combination of emotion and smell. Is contained in every bottle of Odinsleep.

That is the best way I can describe it.

Yin and Yang. Xarmony balance the chaos.

Does anyone know if I‚Äôve induced a permanent allergic reaction? Or will this pass over time? I‚Äôve never had any allergies to smells before üò¢",2021-06-02 01:14:52

Perfumes,[Storytime] How I traveled over 6500km to deliver the perfumes to the customers," Hello everyone Chez Pierre here,

Yes, this is based on a true story and this happened in February this year.

Let's go a little bit back, shall we?

It was 24th December and we were still restricted to send over some countries with Serbian Post, but we could deliver with FedEx. We were preparing to ship the orders that day but we got a phone call, telling us that we cannot ship with them anymore as they classified us as dangerous goods, and all operations should be stopped immediately with FedEx.

As Serbian Post didn't deliver to the Maldives I said fuck it and bought the ticket to deliver to them IRL.

It was a really impulsive decision at the moment but I didn't want to look back, as they were waiting for the orders for so long.

[https://imgur.com/a/D48eyDH](https://imgur.com/a/D48eyDH)

I invited some people to come with me, and the plan was for 5 of us to travel there.

As the customers were excited that I am going to deliver the perfumes IRL they ordered a bit more than they would usual as there won't be any chance to get perfumes in the next period of time.

So overall I had around 50 perfumes ready to bring but suddenly everyone canceled except my friend.

Few days before the flight I got a bit nervous since I had to carry many perfumes and if I got stopped by customs, I would return to monke.

[https://imgur.com/a/OmRSIZ4](https://imgur.com/a/OmRSIZ4)

(Picture I found in my gallery before going to the airport, it was 2 full boxes of perfumes)

Before I took off, I got an idea.

Why wouldn't I wrap the perfumes into aluminum foil, like drug smugglers do, so the scanner won't see the perfumes? Bad idea.

If you wanted to make the worst cover for the customs, don't do this, it looked so suspicious.

[https://imgur.com/a/tgyY8Ir](https://imgur.com/a/tgyY8Ir)

So we bypass everything and land on the Maldives and I am waiting to pick up my luggage when I suddenly notice customer officers standing on the sides and waiting.

I almost shit my pants when I saw them, even though I made a document with me saying that this is only for sample purposes, it wasn't the best feeling.

I got my luggage and saw some guy in front going with big boxes so I decided to go slowly behind him. My intuition was right and he got stopped by the customs and I just passed by and went to get a taxi.

After my friend and I arrived, I went up to meet with one of you guys.

Since there was lockdown in the Maldives and nothing was working after 22:00, we went to some shisha bar that's locked and only locals know about it. We had a great chat, smoked some shisha, had a few drinks. I brought many different perfumes and he was amazed as last time he got them in 2019 so the new ones surprised him.

On the last day, I had a flight late at night, so I decided to meet with one more RepFam in the capital of the Maldives. We ate some burgers, met with his friends, had some hookah, and overall really nice chat about their country.

Overall flying to someone's country and bringing them orders IRL is so much fun and I should do this more often.

That's why I decided to make Europe Tour or Mexico tour this August/September.

I cannot give much information as I got the Repfam jab and they are not allowing it in all countries.

Right now I can enter Spain for sure, so that's why I am waiting for other European countries.

If they open up by August, you can expect me on your doorstep soon.

Here are a few great memories from the trip:

Love you guys and hopefully see you soon

 It's just, although they're great, and cheap I'd love something with a bit more staying power if possible.

 I'm interested in trying something new and have been on many perfume sites and reading the scent profile confuses me. 

I *think* I hate vanilla on me but I'm thinking it's the musk that smells off on me that many vanilla scents seem to have. I also really don't like spicy or sour scents either, if that helps.

So my question is, based on my *likes* is there a scent profile I should be clicking on and adding to my cart when online shopping and not able to smell it in person?

SCENTS I KNOW I LOVE:

I really liked calgon Hawaiian ginger throughout my teens as well as cucumber melon, sweet pea, and plumeria is a definite top scent for me. I believe there was an old amber scent from bath and body works I liked back in the 2010's but they changed the scent or it's just not the same.

 My ultimate favorite scent has always been Victoria's Secret Pure Seduction. ü§§

 Although I remember this Revlon scent (cannot remember the name and have no idea if it's even still in production) that was in a dark red bottle with black feather boa on the cap? That smelled crazy amazing as well.

So I was looking at some more known mists that aren't very expensive and are sold where I live, and I found Body Fantasies.

I was wondering if anyone can tell me if they tried it, will it also completely smell like alcohol?  And would anyone have better recommendations?

After it became discontinued, I settled for D&amp;G Light Blue Eau de Toilette. Stopped using bc I found the dry down to smell like men‚Äôs cologne on my skin. 

Began using Acqua di gioia Eau de Parfum but it‚Äôs just too strong and headache inducing for me. 

What I‚Äôm looking for: Cold scents, light, fresh, airy, feminine, water, aquatic, somewhat fleeting
 
What I dislike: musk, strong, warm, spicy, vanilla, sweet, soapy, powdery, and everything Jo malone

If you have any suggestions, please do let me know! Thank you!!",2021-06-22 15:41:34

Perfumes,Something similar to Mademoiselle Ricci,"Hi, everyone! First time posting here. I'm not a perfume enthusiast, but I need some help from those who are!

Some years ago I purchased an 80ml bottle of Mademoiselle Ricci, and I **loved it**. Now I'm finally reaching the end of the bottle (I don't wear perfume everyday) and I wanted to buy another one... But it's not available anywhere in my country!

Due to covid restrictions, it's hard for me to go out and just try every perfume available in the stores. So, I'd like to narrow my search a bit. I asked around and I got recommended Flower by Kenzo. I was told it was made by the same perfumer, Alberto Morillas, and that it's really similar. The reviews I looked for sounded great and just like what I want.

In short, I like sweet perfumes that are not too fruity, but more floral, and not sweetish, if you know what I mean (I'm sorry, English is not my first language).

Do you guys agree with Flower by Kenzo being a good option for me? Do you have any other recommendations?

[Dior Homme Intense](https://preview.redd.it/2xaodj2kpv171.jpg?width=715&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e47d8d5f8c7791e82153acbdbd19e83707cb23df)

*Dior Homme Intense* EDP opens with a moderate to a solid projection of powdery and purple floral notes. The opening is bold, elegant, mature, unique, and intense.

The iris is your opening most notable note. Within this odor may be described as powdery, visionary, floral gender-neutral, smooth. With a touch of purple and suede floral touch.

The iris is the characteristic note and put alone on peak of the touch lineup. A measure behind is that the ambrette, also referred to as musk mallow, a somewhat sweet, yellow flowery, gentle, slightly musky, woody, and boozy accord.

The musky nuance of this ambrette functions as a mild sharpening and fostering accord, but it is not animalic or pungent.

The lavender has subdued participation behind the iris, but the considerably more powerful iris clouds it. The cherry shaped, vetiver, and cedar are service notes.

## Recommendation: Dior Homme Intense EDP is available discounted for approximately $90. It‚Äôs a perfect fragrance with fantastic functionality for older men that love iris fragrances. This is a superb purchase.",2021-05-28 23:22:36

Perfumes,Searching for a dupe or perfumes I could layer to imitate Deci Dela by Nina Ricci,"My mom used to wear Deci Dela when I was a kid , she still has the powder and it kept a lot of the smell. I purchased 4 bottles ( mini parfum , eau de toilette and eau de parfum) from 3 different resellers on Ebay but they all smelled like baby powder because they‚Äôre so old. I know that some people have had the joy of finding some that kept the freshness of their smell but I didn‚Äôt and I spent a lot. 
I‚Äôve given up trying to find one ( unless someone had a good experience with a seller of older fragrances they could recommend). I also cannot find dupes for this perfume listed online so I would like to ask for suggestions. My perfumes kept  good base notes i believe but most of the heart and nose notes are gone , the freshness is gone . I‚Äôm looking for suggestions that I could maybe layer with it or maybe to make a similar scent 

It is described as a Chypre floral fragrance 
Top notes ; abricot , raspberry , osmanthus , peach , red currant and boronia
Middle notes ; freesia , jasmine , sweet pea and rose 
Base notes ; cypress , sandalwood , patchouli , resins and vanilla  ( it‚Äôs exactly what it smells like now) 
 I‚Äôm mostly looking for the freshness of the top notes when it was freshly sprayed on , I remember the smell of abricot and red fruits .",2021-05-29 12:02:59

Perfumes,Scents similiar to Slumberhouse Norne,"About three years ago I was hunting for a signature scent.  I stumbled across Norne; at first I wasn't sure I liked it, but I discovered that two sprays of Norne and a spray of Mendocino Midnight was PERFECT for what I wanted.

Now I'm hitting the end of my bottle of Norne and cannot find more.  I spent a good amount of time at an artisnal perfume company in SF yesterday, and came back with a few samples that stood out.

* Chris Collins, Danse Sauvage.  Cedarwood, cognac, a bit of vanilla!  Lighter and sweeter compared to Norne, but it smells nice and sticks around.  Lovely fresh cut wood scent.
* Rook Perfumes, Forest.  Incense, nom nom!  Lots of trees, pine and cedar, with a crushed ivy undernote.  This has the darker green resin quality I remember from Norne.
* Imaginary Authors, City On Fire.  Cardamom!  Smoke!  Labdanum.  Dark, smoky, sexy and dangerous.
* Chris Collins, Autumn Rhythm.  Another very green scent...like riding a motorcycle in a leather jacket through a redwood forest.
* Kerosene, Broken Theories.  Smoke, incense, oud.  A less potent blend of sensual dark notes than, say, City on Fire.

Forest is the closest I could find to Norne at this time.",2021-05-30 05:07:13

Perfumes,Perfume bottle design,"I was thinking about perfume bottle design and the trade off between originality and recognizability vs function. For example, there are some perfume bottles that are unique enough that they're pretty much instantly recognizable. In my opinion, examples include Carolina Herrera Good Girl, Ariana Grande Cloud Thank U Next or REM, Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy. There's a unique silhouette that makes it instantly recognizable. At a glance, people can say that the perfume shaped like a high heel is from the Good Girl line, or that the bottle with a bowtie and a giant crystal on the cap is one of the Viva La Juicy variants, or that the bottle with a cloud shaped base is Cloud. This helps a brand market their product as something more unique on the market. It's instantly recognizable as that brand and line. But on the flip side, I've heard from several people that they avoid buying these perfumes because of the unique bottle. People have said that the Good Girl high heel looks tacky, and I personally struggle with the sprayer on that one. Or that the Viva La Juicy bottles look very early 2000s kitsch and out of place on their perfume shelf. If you look at the regular bottles though, they are much more functional but I bet if I asked about a perfume with a rectangular bottle you could name at least 5 different brands that could be. These bottles include, in my opinion, things that while they have a consistent design thought that perfume line, are not unique enough that you can recognize it just from the silhouette. Stuff like Calvin Klein colognes, Maison Francis Kurkdijan perfumes, YSL Black Opium. For example, Chanel, Tom Ford, MFK, Gucci, and Burberry perfumes can be described as having square or rectangular bottles, very boxy with defined planes and edges. I'm not saying that every perfume from those brands fits that description, but a few sure do. The bottles are less recognizable based on their shape, but on the flip side you don't seem to have the problem of the bottle looking too put of place on your perfume shelf or any sprayer problems like with Good Girl. It's more functional than it is unique in shape. 

I want to hear other people's opinions or experiences with this, and whether they prefer a simple bottle that could be confused with a dozen others or a unique bottle that could have design flaws or look too out of place?",2021-04-02 15:41:55

Happy news is that I stopped regretting my purchase the second I actually smelled it! It's such a beautiful scent I'm definitely going to hit pan on this bottle and get a refill when I'm done. I heard it's got a bad rep because it's supposedly made for prostitutes but I don't care; if I smell like a Spanish Lady of the Night in the 30s I'm gonna be smelling like a Spanish Lady of the Night in the 30s!

I also know that sometimes two fragrances can smell like exact dupes for each other, yet they could have totally different notes... sooo Does anyone know of any fragrances that smell exactly/almost exactly like SLC but project much more and last a lot longer?",2021-04-20 02:03:07

Perfumes,Where can I sell perfumes as a job ?,"Hello everyone , 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a self proclaimed fragranceholic , I live in Oman where there are no taxes and perfumes are sold at lower prices due to low rents etc etc. So I have the opportunity to buy and sell perfumes but I dont know where to sell them ! I have a small ebay shop and a small etsy shop. ( all authentic of-course) 

p.s I want to sell niche perfumes like for example baccarat rouge 540 ,intio oud for greatness etc etc 

The problem with ebay is final value fee so they charge 10% on total price including shipping and taxes leaving me with nothing...  etsy is okay but it doesnt really reach my target audience 

can anyone recommend a place and a helping a struggling seller in the era of covid-19 ??

Perfumes,Did i buy a fake tom ford?,So i got a soleil blanc tester off an instagram page. I just got it and it looks very weird. Right off the bat what i noticed from the box is that they slapped a sticker on it with the logo. It does say demonstration tester on the box too. The bottle seems to have the same golden sticker on it and the cap seems very light and a different material from the bottle. The bottle seems to be metallic and the cap is plastic. The smell however seems to be the exact same as the original. Was wondering if this is normal for testers or did i just get scammed?,2021-04-23 18:15:33

Perfumes,Perfume Parlour clone house review,"This post is strictly my opinion and I have paid for all these fragrances out of my own pockets. I only order the sprays, unless I‚Äôve stated otherwise, as I find them to be the easiest to use and they perform more like the original than the oils. When I first get an order in, I leave the fragrances in the fridge for two weeks to macerate before I review them or wear them properly.

&amp;#x200B;

This order was a mixed bag of new fragrances, repeat purchases which I‚Äôve re-reviewed, car diffusers and wax melts.

These reviews take a lot of time and effort to write up, if you would like to order from PP, I would appreciate it if you signed up with my link below. You get \*\*10% off\*\* and I get a little kickback also:

[https://www.perfume-parlour.co.uk/login/=64924](https://www.perfume-parlour.co.uk/login/=64924)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Avalanche Woody 1848 - Creed Aventus\***\*

This was a new purchase and a blind buy for me as I haven‚Äôt smelled the original Aventus before, I decided to get the 60ml ‚Äúextract‚Äù bottle and the presentation and bottle itself is really nice and much better than the 13/30/50ml variants the sprayer is also heavier weighted and as a whole feels of much better quality.

The smell is very fresh, and I get bergamot the most on the opening. Unlike the name suggests I don‚Äôt get a very woody smell but there is a hint of pencil shavings as the fragrance develops and sets on your skin. This has some depth and develops the more you wear it and is definitely one of my favourites from PP.

The longevity and projection is great too and this lasts me all day and has got me multiple compliments and I will for sure be getting another bottle of this when mine runs out!

\*\***Overall: 9/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Agar Gold (Stronger Version) 0038 - Tom Ford Oud Wood**\*\*

A very spicy yet still fresh fragrance. This smells quite close to the original, but I feel like it has something missing and I can‚Äôt quite put my nose on it. The opening has a strong opening of cardamom and I get a very powdery smell from it.

The warmth of the vanilla and tonka bean come through in the dry down. The dry down is a lot closer to the original and both have that mass appealing warmth which I enjoy so much about Oud Wood. This will be great for evening and cooler days Autumn days.

The biggest downside with this clone is that the projection is good for about 30/45 minutes but dies down quite quickly and it becomes a skin scent around the 1 hour 30 minutes. This the worst performance of the bunch and although this is the ‚Äústronger version‚Äù it‚Äôs a terrible performer.

\*\***Overall: 7.4/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Bean Tasty 1604 - Dior Feve Delicieuse**\*\*

My first impressions was that this smells like Play-Doh. The lavender is very prominent in the opening and I get a little mint after about 5 minutes.

The dry down is very milky, nutty, and sweet yet isn‚Äôt feminine leaning as I thought. I get tonka bean and vanilla a lot too and I can smell some iris although it‚Äôs not listed in the notes. The dry down reminds me very much of Dior Homme Intense which is strange since their only mutual note is lavender.

I haven‚Äôt had a chance to smell the original, but I‚Äôve seen and read reviews that say this is a pretty accurate interpretation of the OG but of course doesn‚Äôt come up to par with quality and blending of the Dior private line.

The performance is okay, and the projection is decent too, but this doesn‚Äôt leave a strong scent trail. It more-so lingers on your skin. The longevity is okay too at about 4 hours ish on my skin, but I‚Äôve noticed with all PP clones they do get better with performance and longevity with time.

\*\***Overall: 7.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Card Red 1681 - MFK Baccarat Rouge 540**\*\*

In the initial spray I could smell minty cotton candy. This is a sweet fragrance but is also quite fresh. The opening is harsher and not as well blended as the original, but it still has that famous BR540 DNA and you can tell what it‚Äôs ‚Äúinspired‚Äù from.

The freshness stays throughout, and the mint smell reminds me off Mr Burberry Indigo. I know that mint isn‚Äôt a listed note in the original, but I know many people say they can smell it. Card red remains a thick and creamy scent throughout and this smells a lot more expensive than it is.

A very unisex scent which I think is suitable for any occasion or weather however I can see this excelling in the colder seasons for sure. I have smelled the original numerous times, and this is a very close clone throughout. Since the original is completely synthetic, I imagine it‚Äôs quite an easy fragrance to clone. My only gripe is that this doesn‚Äôt have that depth of BR540 but at a fraction of the price it‚Äôs a great purchase and I can‚Äôt complain.

The performance was okay on this, I was underwhelmed to be honest since the original lasts well over 8 hours on my skin. This projected well for the first hour or two but then became a skin scent and I stayed getting whiffs of it on my arm for 6 hours ish.

\*\***Overall: 8.4/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Exploding Aroma for men 0559 - V&amp;R Spicebomb**\*\*

A fresh opening with the clean bergamot and grapefruit this opens fresher than the original but is still a pleasant smell from the get-go.

In the dry down I continue to get bergamot but now with a little bit of saffron and pink pepper. I also get cardamom and some spicier notes, but it still remains fresh and doesn‚Äôt develop much further into the heavier tobacco and leather notes.

I‚Äôd say this is one of the worst PP clones I‚Äôve smelled. The original is a lot warmer and had a much stronger cinnamon note and was spicier and a more inviting. I‚Äôm going to let this macerate more and I hope it improves however so far, it‚Äôs the least accurate interpretation I‚Äôve smelled from them yet.

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me, but I go nose-blind to this very quickly and projection and longevity on this is amongst the worse, I can‚Äôt smell it on my skin after 2 hours.

\*\***Overall: 4/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Leaf Flavour 0401 - Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille**\*\*

Straight away I get a heavy hit of tobacco and spices, I can smell clove specifically. This is very strong, and the smell almost punched me when I put my nose to it. Truthfully, I‚Äôm not a big fan of the original so I‚Äôm not surprised I wasn‚Äôt a fan of this however this does smell very close to the original TV.

The vanilla is mellow and helps balance the spicy tobacco notes in the opening. I also get some agar wood in the dry down which also helps the fragrance last longer and have that strong almost musky smell. In the dry down this smells identical to the original and I was smelling them side by side. By the 6/7 hour mark I was only getting vanilla.

This is one of the most accurate PP clones I‚Äôve smelled, and I can understand the praise this has. I would recommend this more to an older audience and it is masculine leaning however both men and women could pull this off. I like this a lot more as a candle/wax melt (see below). This fragrance doesn‚Äôt suit my personality or style so I won‚Äôt be getting another bottle but, in the future, I think a more mature me will appreciate this.

The performance on this is amazing. This lasted over 24 hours on my clothes and projects for well over 6 hours on my skin.

\*\***Overall: 5/10 (very good clone I‚Äôm just not a fan of the fragrance itself)**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Sweet Water for men 1262 - AdG Profumo**\*\*

A very fresh and oceanic seawater and sunlight fragrance. This PP clone is very close to the original with a bright and balanced opening. The freshness of the original isn‚Äôt fully there but it is close enough and for the price does a great job.

After 15-20 minutes once the top notes die down it smells almost identical to the original with the sage and rosemary. Where they differ is that I get more patchouli in the PP whereas the original Profumo is smokier with more incense.

The projection on this is okay and it projects well on my skin, but the longevity is terrible and doesn‚Äôt last as long as the original. But, again as with the Oud Wood clone since it‚Äôs so much cheaper than the OG you can go a bit heavier on the sprayer. I was getting decent projection for the first 30 minutes but after that you really struggle to smell this unless your bury your nose into your skin.

\*\***Overall: 7.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Sweet Milan for men 1418 - Armani Code Profumo**\*\*

A sweet yet fresh scent with an initial burst of apple and mandarin. The green apple is very realistic smelling and almost reminds me the mint and pear in Ultra Male. The cardamom is there too but it‚Äôs very faint and if I didn‚Äôt know the note breakdown, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to recognise it.

In the dry down I mainly smell amber and faint whiffs of lavender and the orange blossom. In the dry down this remains fresh and sweet but doesn‚Äôt develop much further. This nails the Code DNA and smells very similar to the original Code Profumo after 30 minutes.

The performance is good and projects well for the first 30 minutes to an hour but after that this became a skin scent on me, and I could smell it faintly after 4 hours. The original is stronger throughout and lasts longer on me too.

\*\***Overall: 8.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***NB: I don‚Äôt have, nor have smelled, the originals of the following three fragrances. These were free samples included in my order which I chose randomly. These aren‚Äôt fragrances I‚Äôd ever pick myself, so I thought to try something out of my comfort zone.**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Leaf Citrus 1814 - Byredo Tobacco Mandarin**\*\*

In the initial spray I get the spicy and fresh notes of the coriander and cumin with a background of mandarin. This is a very smothering and heavy fragrance with an air of freshness to it.

In the dry down I get a lot of sandalwood and Tobacco with a bit of leather, I don‚Äôt have the original to compare so I can‚Äôt comment on how close it is. This fragrance keeps the mandarin at the front and makes me think of walking through a mandarin field in a wet and humid climate. It has an earthy smell in it too from the coriander and cumin. This is very different from anything else I‚Äôve smelled and definitely not your average designer fragrance.

I don‚Äôt like nor dislike this fragrance, it‚Äôs nice in the dry down but very pungent and polarising in the opening.

In the first 30 minutes this projects very well but quickly dries down to become a skin scent. At the 1 hour 30 mark I can only smell sandalwood and faint mandarin. But it continues to linger close to my skin throughout the day but loses projection.

\*\***Overall: 6.2/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Venice 1788 - Tiziana Terenzi Casanova**\*\*

In the opening I straight away get a blast of bergamot and jasmine with powdery notes which give it a make-up type smell too. This shocked me as from the nozzle this smelled like a McDonalds Fish Fillet but spraying it on my arm I was pleasantly surprised with a fresh and flowery smell.

In the dry down I continue to get bergamot and jasmine but now with sweetness and rose of the pink pepper. This, alongside the vanilla, is definitely the best part of the perfume and makes wearing it very enjoyable. Further into the dry down I get more amber and tonka bean, and I can smell some sandalwood too although that‚Äôs not in the note breakdown, which adds some needed depth to this fragrance. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have the original to compare this so I can‚Äôt comment on how accurate this is but from reading reviews of the OG online I feel like this is a good comparison.

Although I am a fan of this, I won‚Äôt be getting a bottle for myself as it is quite feminine leaning. A great scent none the less!

The projection on this was excellent and left a strong scent trail throughout the day.

\*\***Overall: 7.3/10\***\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Glazy Flower 1805 - Killian Roses on Ice**\*\*

This has one of the nicest openings I‚Äôve smelled, it‚Äôs a very balanced and fresh opening with a cocktail of cucumber, lime, and juniper berries. The juniper berries remind me a lot of YSL Y EDP, which is my favourite fragrance and give the fragrance a very mass-appealing blue smell.

Unfortunately, this is another one I don‚Äôt have a sample to compare to so I cannot comment on how accurate it is.

The dry down keeps the fresh aquatic smell but adds some rose and sandalwood. The rose is very faint, and I get slight whiffs of it as well as faint smells of gin. Unlike other rose scents this isn‚Äôt heavy or leathery and sweet but fresh, clean and this smells very designer. This is a unisex fragrance and I think it‚Äôll be greatly suited for a very hot summer day.

This is quite a generic scent and has an oceanic and aquatic smell to it - similar to Acqua Di Gio. I find it really pleasant however I understand this is quite different to what By Killian normally do.

The performance is good but not great. The projection is good for the hour, but this quickly fades after. This still leaves a great scent trail for about 4 hours and I can still smell it faintly on myself around the 6-hour mark.

Out of these three fragrances I‚Äôve tried, I think I‚Äôll be adding this to my list and be getting a 30ml bottle in my next order!

\*\***Overall: 8.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Women‚Äôs fragrances**:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

All these below were purchased for my mum for her to wear to work, she has the originals of all of these, so I was able to directly compare them. I tried these all myself so bear in mind these are my opinions and I know I‚Äôm not the target audience for these fragrances.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Florence Notorious II for women 0234 - Gucci Guilty for her**\*\*

Straight away in the opening I get a floral lilac and patchouli scent. It‚Äôs very close to the original in the opening and has that soapy and almost make up type smell to it - very feminine and powdery. It‚Äôs not an overpowering scent and good for pretty much any occasion.

The dry down is soft and spicy with a hint of mandarin and citrus. The dry down is identical to the original and both have a synthetic smell to them. I like the original smell however I think Gucci tend to use cheaper smelling ingredients and this is a lot better value than the original.

The projection and sillage is great on this too, this leaves a strong trail for the first 30 minutes to an hour. Afterwards it becomes a fainter scent, sticking closer to the skin and lasts around 5 hours.

My mum was a fan of this one however her biggest flaw was the longevity and projection, but that was expected since the OG isn‚Äôt a great performer too.

\*\***Overall: 6.8/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Venom for women 0344 - Dior Poison**\*\*

Immediately you get a strong hit of plum and incense. The opening is very sweet, and I get some spicy notes too. There‚Äôs a slight petrol smell to this too, similar to Dior Fahrenheit, which is intoxicating and draws you in.

In the dry down it becomes a smokier scent with the vanilla, amber and sandalwood but keeps that seductive sweet smell from the opening. The dry down is identical to the original, it‚Äôs a classic DNA you can recognise straight away.

This projects and performs as well as the original. It lasts over 7 hours on my skin and you can smell it on clothes the next day too. The scent trail this leaves is exactly the same as the original. This is a very heavy fragrance so I would recommend this for evenings or colder weather.

My mum enjoyed PP‚Äôs interpretation of this however she didn‚Äôt like the opening, she found the initial opening, first 15 minutes or so, to be harsh on her nose.

\*\***Overall: 7/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Invisible for women 0135 - Ch\*nel Coco EDP**\*\*

In the opening of this I could smell peach, jasmine and rose as the main notes however I was also getting some sandalwood in the opening too which adds a layer of depth.

In the dry down I still mainly get sandalwood and rose but it‚Äôs a bit sweeter and more mellow with the vanilla and tonka bean. Comparing this directly to the original, this clone isn‚Äôt as strong and rich as the original however I prefer that. I find the original to be smothering and it makes me a bit nauseous however this PP clone is a toned-down version.

This fragrance is for my mum, and to her this smells identical to the original however to my nose this smells a lot more synthetic, which is expected.

Overall, the performance on this is close to the original in the sense that it projects for many hours and leaves a strong, recognisable, scent trail. The longevity is good too at around 7/8 hours on my skin.

Yet another great scent, my mum had the same comments as me on this; that it doesn‚Äôt have the same magic as the original but a good interpretation none the less.

\*\***Overall: 7.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Noire Poison for women 1137 - YSL Black Opium**\*\*

A very iconic smell which PP have nailed. A very sweet, almost boozy, opening with the pear and orange blossom. I can smell some praline and vanilla too which boost the sweet smell further.

The dry down is fruitier with the sharpness of the pink pepper and further on the coffee adds a gourmand almost chocolatey note. From opening to dry down this smells exactly the same as the original but perhaps doesn‚Äôt have the same clarity as the OG, by which I mean I can‚Äôt distinguish the notes as clearly as the OG but this clone still has that recognisable DNA and remains accurate throughout.

This projects like a beast and lasts over 8 hours on my skin. My mum had no complaints about this and was her second favourite out of the lot (TF Noir de Noir being first).

\*\***Overall: 7.8/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Repeat Purchases**\*\*

These are purchases I‚Äôve made in the past in with PP and decided to get another bottle of because I enjoyed them that much:

\*\***Only Man 0666 - D&amp;G The One**\*\*

This is my favourite PP scent and my go to for the evenings, I‚Äôve already reviewed this and had to get another bottle when my first one finished. This is very close to the original, but I‚Äôve found it lasts longer than the OG and being so cheap I can spray a lot of this too. I highly recommend everyone to try this especially if you‚Äôre a fan of the original!

\*\***Overall: 9/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Beyond 1702 - JPG Ultramale**\*\*

Another repeat purchase and this is also great however I‚Äôve found this a bit sickly. This has some of the strongest projection and longevity of any PP I‚Äôve tried and can be smelled easily the next day. Regardless this is a very close interpretation of the original and I would recommend this also.

\*\***Overall: 7.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Pioneer 0737 - MB Explorer**\*\*

Yet again another repurchase but this wasn‚Äôt for me but for my dad who absolutely abuses his fragrances and overspray‚Äôs than anyone I‚Äôve ever met. This is a clean inoffensive but generic fragrance and great for any situation. The performance and longevity are good, and this lasts all day but doesn‚Äôt develop much and stays the same throughout, which isn‚Äôt a bad thing but something to note.

\*\***Overall: 7.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Cyber Sports Extreme 0574 - Ch\*nel Allure Homme Sport EE**\*\*

This is my second bottle of PP CAHSEE, I grew to love this and actually prefer it to Navy Intense (BdC EDP). It opens with a very strong orange and remains very fresh and summery throughout with the mint. The tonka bean comes into play too in the dry down and adds much needed depth to this fragrance. My only gripe is that this smells a lot more synthetic than the original but of course that‚Äôs expected but on the other hand this has beast performance. This has excellent projection and lasts all day so be careful on the trigger.

\*\***Overall: 8.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Passion for men 0668 - Versace Eros**\*\*

Another repeat but again this is for my dad. A very known scent and I feel like there‚Äôs not much more to say except it‚Äôs fresh and minty. This PP clone is very close to the original and projects like a beast for hours!

\*\***Overall: 8/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Black Extreme 0645 - Tom Ford Noir de Noir**\*\*

This was for my mum and she‚Äôs a big fan of NdN. No joke every time we go out to see family or friends, she‚Äôs gotten compliments and is always asked what perfume she‚Äôs wearing, so much so my grandmother has asked me to get her a bottle of this too!

This is mature rose and chocolate scent which is unisex and performs like a beast, easily lasting over 24 hours on clothes and the projection is great too.

\*\***Overall: 8.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Others**:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Car Diffusers**:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Passion 0688 - Versace Eros**\*\*

The small glass bottles these came in are very nice and look great in my car, they come with an orange lace/string to hang with and wooden caps.

The smell is very close to the original Eros and I‚Äôve already reviewed the Passion clone above. The car diffusers slowly release the smell and with Passion (Eros) you mainly get the mint which you can smell as soon as you enter the car.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Exploding Blossom 0215 - V&amp;R Flowerbomb**\*\*

I‚Äôve not smelled the original however smelling the bottle, the name Flowerbomb completely fits. I get a lot of patchouli and jasmine.

This isn‚Äôt as strong as the Passion (Eros) car diffuser but does still give a very floral scent as soon as you enter the car. You get nose blind to these car diffusers quickly, but they are noticeable at first.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Wax Melts**:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Leaf Flavour 0401 - Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille**\*\*

For ¬£2.00 there were 7 little wax pieces and I wasn‚Äôt expecting much if I‚Äôm being honest since they‚Äôre quite small but wow was I blown away. The smell is beautiful, and one wax piece filled the whole bottom floor of my house for hours!

I much prefer Leaf Flavour (and TV) as a candle and a room scent rather than on me.

I‚Äôve used PP‚Äôs Golden Agar 0636 (Tom Ford Oud Wood) and this was very similar, from what I can remember. I would recommend this over the Oud Wood wax melts since it is almost half the price and smells just as warm and inviting.

I recommend adding some wax melts to your next order and for ¬£2.00 this is a no brainier!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Final Comments/TLDR**:\*\*

This is a collection of multiple orders bunched into one big post so if you made it to the end, I appreciate you taking the time!

Overall, I am happy with the purchases and tend to go off highly recommend PP clones or fragrances I really like to make an order. I‚Äôve found the performance and longevity on PP fragrances to improve over time, which is understandable since, I think, they‚Äôre blended as the orders come in.

This review took me over 2 months to write and I would really appreciate it if, you‚Äôre interested in making an order, to use my referral link. This \*\*isn‚Äôt\*\* a paid or sponsored post, I am a genuine fan of Perfume Parlour products and will be putting in another order for again another review.

Let me know your favourites to try for my next review! So far, my wish list is:

\*\***Immortal 1871 (Roja Dove - Elysium)**\*\*

\*\***Torn 1281 (Terre d‚ÄôHermes)**\*\*

\*\***Strong Pashtun 0031 (Black Afgano)**\*\*",2021-04-26 18:42:46

Perfumes,Personal Perfume Nitpicks?,"I don't know if I'm the only one but I am very picky with the atomizer of the bottle. Of course the atomizer won't actually determine whether or not I'll get a perfume but it's definitely something I take note of. Best comparison is Tea Rose and my Incanto Amity bottles. One thing I love about the Amity bottle is that it sprays wonderfully, smooth long sprays making it easy to get a lot of product. Tea Rose on the other hand is the opposite; it's like when I press on the atomizer it just coughs out the product. The short sprays are irritating when Tea Rose isn't very strong on me so I need to spray more of the scent. 

What are your personal nitpicks you think only you have?",2021-04-27 02:35:24

Perfumes,I'm escentually clueless when it comes to this. Hopeless husband that needs help.,"Hi everyone. I apologize for my absolute ignorance on this subject. I'm trying to find a good perfume for my wife. She's celebrating her first mother's Day and in addition to other gifts, I know this is something that she has wanted for some time. My question is this - my wife really likes a certain perfume that my sister-in-law has. It is called Chloe edp. She said that she would really love to have something like that, but she doesn't want the exact thing as she wants to have something different from her sister. I've tried to read up all on this topic, I've gone through these forums and looked at other websites as well, but what I keep seeing are answers about other perfumes that were made to smell like or ""dupe"" this one but are not exactly the same or are cheap smelling. I have no issue of price point, I want to get her something that she will really enjoy and enjoy wearing, but I just don't know what to be looking for. I want to find some examples of perfumes that may match the I guess general pallet of the one that she likes. I know she doesn't like really fruity things, or things that smell "" cheap "" or "" like something a high schooler would wear "". Admittedly I don't really know what this means, but I do see lots of mentions in other posts about things smelling cheap, or overly sweet, or like something that reminds them of when they were young. Again, I apologize for my absolute ignorance, as I don't wear cologne and have no experience in this area. I'm just hoping that someone out there can suggest a few different perfumes that may meet the criteria that she tends to enjoy - such as floral, complex, not very fruity, not with a heavy alcohol smell, something that a young adult woman would wear. Thank you all so much in advance for any advice. I truly appreciate it.",2021-04-30 01:23:41

Perfumes,Mini review on 5 warmer/muskier perfumes based on suggestions I got from this subreddit üòå,"Replica By the Fireplace: a lot of people said that it smells like a camp fire and is better suited as a candle fragrance, but I disagree! On first spray it smelled smokey and spicy (like a campfire lol) but as it dried down it started to smell so nostalgically beautiful of sweet marshmallows with a gentle smokiness trailing it. I understand why people feel it works better as a room spray or something, however on my skin its delicately sweet with a little something extra

Narciso Rodriguez Pure Musc: I personally don't like any of the NR perfumes I'm about to review lol but this one does not read as musk to me. It just smells like a powdery grandma.

NR for her: this smells like coco chanel but with a lot of rose, which to me is extremely unpleasant because I despise the smell of roses lol

NR fluer Musc: this perfume also smells quite powdery and reminds me of marc jacobs daisy perfume but a little bit brighter and less offensive (again, not a fan of florals but this one is ok. It might be nice in the summer time!) 

Aerin Amber Musk: this initially smells very warm and simple (meaning not a ton of notes going on, just a pleasant amber scent) but then as it dries down and wears it just smells like a powdery grandmother üôÉ

Perfumes,Which one should I purchase first? Marc Jacobs Eau So Decadent or Chance Eau Fraiche?,"Currently have the budget for ONLY ONE of these. I‚Äôve already tried samples of both of them and have decided to get full bottles but idk which one to get first.

MJ Eau So Decadent- it‚Äôs such a unique scent to me and there isn‚Äôt anything like it in my collection except for the OG Decadence (although they aren‚Äôt *that* alike). Plus, the packaging is so cute, I love it truly. When I tried the sample, it lasted really long on my skin as well. 

Chanel Chance Eau Fraiche- majority of my collection leans more on fresh, citrusy scents so this is right up my alley and I just know I need this in my collection. Fell in love with it on the first spray. I already have the OG Chance EDT and EDP which I also love. Eau Fraiche is a more unisex citrus which I also don‚Äôt have in my collection yet because most of my citruses are sweet and floral. This doesn‚Äôt last too long on my though.

Please let me know your thoughts! I know they‚Äôre totally on different sides of the fragrance spectrum but which one do you like better?

Beautiful (Estee Lauder), Jessica McClintock, and ‚Äî throwing it back ‚Äî Shania by Stetson.  I loved its bold, but still feminine, scent. That was my go-to until it was discontinued.  So... I‚Äôm looking for something strong but floral.  And with some decent staying power once it‚Äôs sprayed.  Not into the dominantly earthy scents at all.   I‚Äôm not into anything that‚Äôs sickeningly sweet though.  It‚Äôs got to have some deeper tones/a deeper base, if that makes any sense. 

Oh, I also love the Sea Island Cotton scent from Bath and Body Works. But some of the technically-floral ones like Sweet Pea just make me gag.

Perfumes,Looking for a fragrance with Tonka/vanilla and Yellow floral. Any suggestions?,"Hi! Thank you so much for reading this :)

i really like fragrances with tonka (eg coco madmoiselle intense) and i used to love a discontinued perfume with mimosa (yellow floral) from yves rocher 
https://www.basenotes.net/ID26132790.html

Im looking for a scent that is close to the skin, fresh and not too heavy, wearable throughout the year. Im open to layering, but dont want a huge projection.

I cannot wear any fragrances with amber, as my skin amplifies it too much, in general my skin tends to bring out heavy notes and weights the scent down. I would appreciate something that has a light to medium projection and smells fresh yet warm and cozy. Im not too fond of powdery notes.

Again thanks so much for any suggestions :)",2021-02-25 21:50:44

But you still can‚Äôt help loving and wearing them. They don‚Äôt scream for attention and might be terribly safe or mainstream but still your love persists.

It‚Äôs not about what others find to be blah or meh, it has to be a scent that you find unremarkable, but you love it. Oooh the irony of it all!

For example, mine would be Aquolina Pink Sugar. It‚Äôs sweet, it‚Äôs cotton candy, and that‚Äôs about all I can say. Meh. But I was 23 when it came out and all my friends and I were in love.

When I was younger, my go to's were D&amp;G Light Blue, Paris Hilton, Versace Bright Crystal, Escada Rockin Rio, and Philosophy Amazing Grace. Mostly light and sweet/fruity/floral scents, in my opinion.

I've been using Romance by Ralph Lauren and Rose Jam from Lush. Though they smell nice, I'm not 100% sure if I'd like to stick to any of them.

I recently bought Philosophy Amazing Grace again because of nostalgia (and because it was on sale) but I don't know, I guess I don't like the scent as much anymore.

Maybe my preference has changed so I tried to go for something more mature and warm. I sampled Angel by Thierry Mugler and Tom Ford Fucking Fabulous, but ended up not liking both of them. To me, they smell sweet but very musky -- kinda reminds me of my grandma's scent.

‚ÄúDid you just do laundry today? You smell like clean laundry; like laundry detergent...‚Äù

D E T E R G E N T 

So I start smelling the clothes I just took off (like a crazy person) and low and behold she was right. I smellt like fucking clean laundry!!! 

Why??? Was my mistake putting on perfume and then getting dressed?? Should I start looking for a new combination? Because I do not spend over 100‚Ç¨ in smells to be outshined by fucking detergent. Or should I wash my clothes with some perfume or something? I had washed my clothes like a week prior I just keep them all folded with more clean clothes so may be the smell remained?

Perfumes,Affordable perfumes that actually smell like vanilla?,"Looking to finally move on from my body spray days, but can‚Äôt seem to find a perfume that I love. I really like the smell of vanilla and would love something with a very strong vanilla scent, but I don‚Äôt like fruity or floral scents which seem to accompany most vanilla scents. Also most vanilla scents I‚Äôve tried don‚Äôt seem to actually smell all that much like vanilla?

I love scents that are really warm and cozy and basically smell like baked goods. Not opposed to somewhat rustic or sexy/spicy scents but would prefer for vanilla to still be dominant and distinguishable.

Does anyone have recommendations? Would love to keep the price range &lt;$50 but my absolute max budget is probably around $90.",2021-01-06 08:27:42

Perfumes,Advice and suggestions for a young guy!,"Hey guys,

I‚Äôve been wearing cologne/fragrance for a few years now, I‚Äôm a 20 year old guy, I‚Äôm not any sort of big clubber/ f boy/ etc although I love getting extremely over the top every once in a while, apart from that I‚Äôm chill, relax and have a chat sort of person, maybe my fragrance choices below will help as well?

I‚Äôve been wearing CH Priv√© for a couple years, probably my #1, I recently (read today xD) bought the sauvage EDP which I love (I really like the parfum but doesn‚Äôt project as well/ last as long).

For my fresher scents I‚Äôve got Jean Paul Gautier le male, which I like but I do find disappears quick, and Pierre Cardin pour homme (cheap and only lasts 30 minutes).

When thinking of suggestions, I like the smell of one million for example, but would NEVER EVER wear it. I also recently smelt terre d‚Äôhermes which I like, but it smell a bit like millipedes to me ( I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up with my brain)

So I‚Äôm looking for ideas for something long lasting, yet nothing like what I have, something that could be worn anywhere, but I‚Äôm open to more specific smells if they‚Äôre good enough.

Any compliment grabbers are appreciated, but not so common you smell them everywhere you go.

Budget isn‚Äôt a problem, I don‚Äôt mind spending the money if it‚Äôs worth it

Thanks for your ideas!

I got this perfume and deodorant when I was younger. It is called Black Star by Avril Lavigne. The perfume I didn‚Äôt live as much as the deodorant and I used it up fairly quickly. The deodorant on the other hand, I still have some of it left. 
Yes, I saved this maybe five year old bottle. No, I haven‚Äôt used it up. Last time I used it was when I met my now fianc√©e, hence one of the reasons it means so much to me. 

I have no clue as to where I can get one that smells even remotely like it, and every online shop doesn‚Äôt have any of them left - I checked everywhere from local shops (Denmark) to international sites in hopes to find this deodorant. Now I have accepted that it cannot be bought anymore, but I wish to find preferably a deodorant that comes close to it in the smell, because I absolutely adore it.

The closest I've come upon is a seller on Etsy who sells an oil by the name Cleopatra, but does not list any of the fragrant notes in the oil. I tried to reach out to then to ask specifics on the scent, but no response. So I'm surprised there haven't been any sellers who have duped this fragrance. As a matter of fact, I have not seen any Tocca fragrances made in oil form by independent sellers. Does anyone know why? Does Tocca have strict copyrights or are their fragrances too hard to dupe?

Perfumes,"[Chez Pierre] Cheaper Shipping Price Available now, New Arrivals, Maldives....."," Hello, guys Perfume Guy here,

So today I have a big announcement to make!

# Cheaper Shipping Price Available now

After a long battle with Post-Serbia, I can proudly say that today we have better shipping prices!

Here are new shipping prices:

[https://imgur.com/a/HUhU1qq](https://imgur.com/a/HUhU1qq)

It's a big price difference, I am really glad we succeeded to get prices like this.

Since it's now by grams, here is an example of how much does each bottle weighs.

[https://imgur.com/a/E9vmXEb](https://imgur.com/a/E9vmXEb)

We added a weight calculator on checkout so you can see how much does your package weighs and it will automatically update the shipping price.

So now for example, if you want to buy 5x20ml, the weight will be 165g +80g from box = 245g (125-250g price)

That's almost twice as cheaper as the previous price was.

# New Arrivals

We also added 3 new perfumes

Inspired by:

Montale Intense Cafe - Coffee Dream

Dior J'adiore - Bredore

Jean-Paul Gaultier Scandal - Drama Queen

They are available now on the website

# Maldives

I'll be traveling to the Maldives on 17th February. If any RepFam is in the Maldives on that period, please hit me before that date and I'll bring you some perfume to try out and chill.

Again thank you very much for the support, and if you need any help, please let me know and I will be happy to help,

Much Love,

I hope to get some help from you guys!¬†I am recently wanting to switch up the perfume I have been using -- don't get me wrong I still like that scent a lot but I feel like it suits me better in the summer and it's a bit too sweet for my age (college student, one year till graduation). However, I am overwhelmed by all the options because I don't know a lot about perfumes. Given it is COVID now, I also have very limited opportunities to go to the store and smell each scent in person. I am wondering if anyone can suggest some perfumes that check the boxes of what I am looking for!

Perfume I used before (since high school):¬†A'PIEU My Handy Roll-On in Peach

Perfume I am looking for:

\- better suits in fall and winter ( I live in Vancouver so the weather is cold and rainy)

\- not too mature for a 20 yo (but not overly sweet as well because I look way younger than 20)

\- contains notes of vanilla and caramel? (I don't like floral smells)

\- gives a clean but warm and cozy feeling

\- affordable¬†but preferably not too common (I once saved up to¬†get a Chloe roller but turns out a lot of my friends are using that...)

I actually have one in mind -- MAC Creme d'nude, and I went to the store to smell it recently. I smell nothing besides the alcohol in the first 10 minutes, but it smells good later when I got home. My mum said it does not suit me because it smells a bit dirty... if that makes sense? Creme d'nude checked all my boxes (vanilla and caramel are actually on the list because of this)¬†but I am hesitating because impressions are a huge factor in determining if a perfume suits me!

Sorry for the long passage and I hope someone can help me out! Thank you in advance:)",2021-01-13 11:55:03

Perfumes,Narciso Poudr√©e for my little sister ?,"Hello ! (:

I would like to offer a perfume to my little sister for her 30th birthday.

Do you think Narciso Poudr√©e by Narciso Rodriguez 
may be suitable for a rather introverted young woman, who doesn't want to disturb, gentle, dreamy, romantic, quite innocent, peaceful,  a little fragile, who you want to protect? Who likes to prepare herself without overdoing it? (Never too sophisticated make-up, for example. Not the type to comb her hair for hours either).
Her companion says she's a little fairy, and it's true, she has that aura.
She's INFP enneagram 9, if you are familiar with it.

She likes to wear a cute  little dress with boots, or a blazer with collar. She loves hats, too.

This perfume is not too ""ladylike"" assertive? It's rather versatile and goes everywhere, doesn't it? Simple, soft, elegant and not disturbing?

She knows Narciso Rodriguez For Her EDT (the black bottle)but finds a too strong note in it as soon as it is sprayed, probably the omansthus.

She likes Gucci Bloom by Gucci, but deplores the fact that it doesn't hold much on her. It is true that the imagery around this very ethereal perfume suits her well. But apparently the other flankers of Gucci Bloom don't hold much on many people either...

She has had sweeter, fruitier perfumes before, but every time she soon gets tired of them. She changes a lot of fragrances, but told me that she would like to find her signature scent. She doesn't

Perfumes,Perfume brand help?,Hi. Does anybody know this specific perfume brand? The bottle has a huge text across the bottle with the text written vertically. Also the text design kinda looks like Solinotes where in the text and color depends on the base note/fragrance of each bottle. I know it kinda looks like Solinotes Paris but I am pretty sure it's not because of the bottle design. Thanks in advance :),2021-01-16 04:15:25

I love my perfume good girl by carolina herrera. I think for me I love more masculine scents, he's never said he hates it, but I don't think he loves it.  For my birthday he bought me armani diamonds which is nice but not my go to, he really likes it on me though.
I'm not sure if that was helpful, I'm just trying to give an idea of what kind of scents he likes! I want to buy something he likes rather than what I like as I've realised our taste in perfumes is quite different, although I do always think he smells great! :)

Perfumes,Similar to Bulgari Rose Essentielle,"Hello!

I would like to ask for a recommendation for a perfume similar to Bulgari Rose Essentielle.
I love the scent and I am running low on my current bottle. I heard this has been discontinued. :(

What I am using right now, I found it in Winners(Canada) 2-3yrs ago and I was so happy because I have been searching everywhere that was reasonably priced. 

So if you have a recommendation that's similar to the scent of Rose Essentielle, it would be highly appreciated.

Thank you.",2021-01-16 14:50:42

Perfumes,"What makes a good perfume? Is it personal taste, and how much does the body of the wearer influence the smell?","Is is personal, or does the majority agree on a scent being good?  
Can a perfume be good or bad, depending on who is wearing it, is that how much a body can change the smell? Or is it really only for the very sharp noses among us who can smell the difference?

I understand it depends on whether it's strong, fresh, sweet, fruity, and so on. Just yesterday I had tested a perfume (as a man, for men) which was rather strong, much like a deodorant. Reminded me it smelled as strong as smelling whiskey, but that could be because the saleslady sprayed a full dose on my wrist, instead of spreading it over my body at that point as I usually would myself. So I don't know how it would have really smelled like on myself.

The other scent on my other wrist I could barely smell, it was like it wasn't really there. Tho it was sweeter, so probably not as stimulating, but just as much present.  


Anyhow, I got salestalked and bought 4 vails one of each, strongly considering to just bring it back since I only ""woke up"" later that evening and it wasn't my wisest purchase by a long shot. So I will try to return it, it's still packaged in the foil. But I want to use this opportunity to learn what a good perfume is and what to pay attention to?",2021-01-17 23:01:36

What I've smelled or owned so far 

Arianna Grande Cloud- I don't like the initial smell but the dry down is ok
Flowerbomb- not my cup of tea too powdery

YSL Mon Paris- Love it but doesn't last long on me :(

Rihanna Reb' Fleur- fav celebrity perfume so far, waiting to try Jennifer Lopez Glow

Versace Bright Crystal is just ok for me

Carolina Herrera Good Girl is a bit too suttle for me, lasting power is midrange for me

Miss Dior is good so far debating if I should get J'adore, seem like a lighter version of Miss Dior. I'm new to this so if they are completely different forgive me

I've never really used any perfume in my life except for certain situations like parties, celebrations etc. where I used some [Sergio Tacchini Stile](https://www.google.com/search?q=sergio+tacchini+stile&amp;safe=active&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03ewYnQpZzjlZXDtte-5OXeiX0-3g:1606947420356&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjRzKbRqbDtAhUllosKHc6nAFkQ_AUoAXoECBAQAw&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=937#imgrc=131fcSwmKhKPOM) that I got as a birthday gift some years ago. It has worked well, but a family member told me I should spice things up a bit, to which I agree with. I'd like to be presentable to the other students/classmates that I'll meet and get to know.

And also as weird as it may sound, I'd like to attract especially the girls/women as I'd like to go out on potential dates/date nights because this uni is told to be a very attractive place to seek and have dates on. I know smell isn't everything but I just want my perfume to contribute on top of me as a person. 

Last but not least as a student, money is a concern but based on my current expenses I'm saving about an equivalent of 157 USD per month so I think I'm ready to invest a little if that means I'm getting a greater perfume.

So, any suggestions/recommendations?",2020-12-03 06:33:03
Perfumes,Love/Hate a perfume sample,"Just getting into perfume samples, I‚Äôve used the same thing for the last 20 years and didn‚Äôt even pick it out for myself since it was a gift but COVID boredom‚Äôs got me looking for things in my life to change up. I just got a Bvlgari sample of Rose Goldea Blossom Delight and I can‚Äôt decide if I like or hate it. When spritzing it I‚Äôm overwhelmed by how soapy and sharp it is but if applied to my skin it mellows down in 20-30 minutes and I like it much better. 

There are so many good perfumes out there but my limited experience so far is that pretty much everything smells different straight out of the bottle vs when actually wearing it. Should I put up with 20 minutes of irritating my nose every time I put it on in order to smell nice for the next few hours after that? Is this something I‚Äôve got to get used to when using stronger Eau de Parfum rather than the weaker Toilettes and Colognes? I‚Äôm not sure how unusual it is to dislike a perfume straight out of the bottle vs on my skin. Should I pass on this one and try to find one I like both ways?",2020-12-03 07:35:22

I really enjoy BonBon and Flowerbomb by Viktor and Rolf, but I find they don‚Äôt last as long as I would like. I am looking for something that is long lasting, with good silage, while also being on the sweet/fruity side. Can anyone please help?",2020-12-04 13:31:06

I am starting with a few that I like the scent on and plan on using chlo√® edp, Burberry her, flowerbomb, dolce and gabbana dolce, Marc jacobs daisy love and victor and Rolf Bon Bon.

Perfumes,Glossier You - Or Why I Love Fragrance," Fragrance, like many things, is highly subjective. My mother loves vibrant white florals, my father prefers rich amber and vanilla notes, and I tend to lean towards gourmands and fruity notes, but I appreciate many different fragrance families. I have a modest but growing collection of full sizes and samples and my two favorite fragrances are **BR540** and **Black Orchid**. I appreciate a challenging fragrance, even if it's not my thing.

That being said, nothing prepared me for the olfactory hellscape I experienced today when I received my package of **Glossier You** in the mail. I had purchased it for 25% off on Cyber Monday, and had been wanting to buy it for a long time based on its rave reviews. It arrived in a cute, Millennial pink package with a small vinyl collectible sticker. My hands trembled with anticipation as I held the minimalist bottle in my hands. I uncapped the bottle.

As a musk/""your skin but better"" lover, I had been excited to smell this for quite some time. The notes are listed as iris root, pink pepper, ambrette, ambrox, and musk. Nothing too offensive or something I could ever imagine disliking. 

I was wrong.

Smelling nothing from the bottle directly, I proceeded to spray my wrists and chest liberally and was immediately slapped in the face by a pungent, indescribable, awful cloud of *something* that I've never smelled in a fragrance and never ever want to smell again. It immediately turned my stomach and triggered my fight or flight response. Panicked, I ran down the hall to ask my husband's opinion. He shoved his nostrils onto my wrist, and his soured, crinkled-up face told me everything I needed to know. 

""Oh, honey, it smells like asparagus pee. Like the pee after you eat asparagus.""

While I could not discern that specific note, it dawned on me that I *could* now detect a tangible atmosphere in this putrid cloud. That hellish *something* convalesced into an olfactory evocation that I wish my brain hadn't conjured. I sniffed my wrists again and I immediately envisioned an old, musty library full of octogenarian women eating butternut squash soup in unison. It smelled somehow like old paper, old powder, denture cream, and wet synthetic gourd vegetables simultaneously. It was utterly disgusting. I announced this revelation to my husband and promptly scrubbed my skin of the foul liquid, looked up Glossier's return policy, and sent an email to customer service.

I am not writing this to dissuade anyone from purchasing **Glossier You.** In fact, I'm writing this because despite my violent aversion to **Glossier You,** delving into the world of fragrance has allowed me to become so affected by a scent that the experience itself becomes a story. A few years ago, I embarked on a road trip by myself with nothing but a few camping supplies and a new pair of red Converse on my feet. The first night I set up camp, I met a group of Appalachian Trail hikers staying at the site next to mine. They were around my age and they were dirty, tired, and welcoming. We all swapped campfire tales over beers and at one point, they asked me about my trip and I sheepishly confessed that I just wanted to see if I could do it. I told them I was worried about things going wrong. One of the women in the group looked at me and said, ""When things go wrong, it's a better story."" 

That stuck with me. Life is full of **Glossier You's** and no one can tell you when they'll pop up. Unexpected twists and turns and quirks. Overhyped experiences that fall flat or utterly disappoint you. No matter what, there will always be a **Glossier You** to experience and overcome and laugh about. Better yet, one person's **Glossier You** might be another person's **Black Orchid.** I'm glad I met my first scrubber today, and that it provided me the opportunity to think deeply about why I enjoy this hobby. And thank you, Glossier, for providing me with the opportunity to tell a good story.",2020-12-10 02:41:15

**Beyond For Men 1702 (JPG Ultra Male)**

A very sweet pear scent which definitely rivals Eros for a ‚Äúgoing out‚Äù fragrance. The opening of this is wonderful, I wore this to a small birthday gathering for a friend and received multiple compliments. I‚Äôd say the fragrance is very close to the original, it has the sweet playful notes with a bit of the JPG dna. This lasts a long time as I could smell it on my jacket the next day and it was still projecting. I really enjoyed this scent and I‚Äôm going to get a bottle of the real deal since apparently it‚Äôs being discontinued. 

Performance was good lasting for 12 hours on me and projects great also at about 2/3 feet. 

**Overall: 8.5/10**

___


**Tranquil Perfume For Men 0678 (The Scent of Peace)**

A very nice pineapple and bergamot opening, unfortunately I don‚Äôt have a sample of the real SoP so I can‚Äôt comment on how close it is to the original but as a fragrance it is very nice regardless. This is a safe office scent and won‚Äôt offend anyone. The dry down is a very smooth with vetiver and fruity notes. The scent trail this leaves is great and I understand the comparisons to Aventus however this takes is a very juicy fruity scent. I do enjoy wearing this fragrance but I doubt I‚Äôll be picking up a bigger bottle. 

The projection is okay and performance was decent lasting about 5ish hours on my skin. 

**Overall: 7.5/10**

___


**Italian Gent For Men 1521 (Prada L‚ÄôHomme)**

I was very pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this. The opening is similar and has the same vibe as the original but it‚Äôs not quite there. The dry down however is identical and wearing this to the library my friends commented twice one how good I smelled and even asked what I was wearing. A very fresh and clean scent as has been said a million times before. Can‚Äôt go wrong with this, great pick up. 

Performance was okay lasted around 5/6 hours on my skin and wasn‚Äôt the best projector but it lingers for a while on my clothes and it doesn‚Äôt offend anyone. 

**Overall: 8/10**

Another great scent! This one isn‚Äôt that close to me, it has a similar vibe and does have the BdC DNA but that Chanel ‚Äúmagic‚Äù isn‚Äôt there. BdC Parfum was the scent that got me interested in fragrance in the first place and this doesn‚Äôt scratch that itch but it‚Äôs to be expected with such a price difference. This is a very clean and mass appealing scent, it‚Äôs very nice and I‚Äôve received compliments from friends. 

The performance was okay at about 6 hours on me with projection at 1/2 feet for a couple hours. This is no beast in performance but a safe fragrance I can recommend to anyone. 

**Overall: 8/10**

___


**Pioneer For Men 0738 (MB Explorer)**

Wow. This is an amazing scent definitely one of my favourites. When I first smelled this I thought it smelled exactly like Sauvage but once I let it rest in a cool dark place for a couple weeks and it came back even better. There‚Äôs a strong bergamot opening similar to the original and the dry down is a lot less loud as the opening. I couldn‚Äôt smell the leather note as strong as the original but the black currant accord was coming through for sure. My friends really enjoyed this one also and this is another one I‚Äôll be considering for a full bottle also! 

This lasted well for about 5/6 hours on me but the projection was great at about 2 feet. This left a strong scent trail as I walked past and I could smell it on myself now and then. 

**Overall: 8.5/10** 

___


**Wood Fire 1874 (MM By The Fireplace)**

This smells exactly the same to me as the original. The original is a bit brighter and not as dense as the PP in the opening but the dry down is identical. The scent is nice but not something I can see myself wearing often. A sweet and warm fragrance, I get the burnt marshmallow and burning wood warmth that everyone talks about with this scent. I can see this being great on a winters night and the name ‚ÄòBy The Fireplace‚Äô is a great way to describe this fragrance. 

Performance is good, I could smell this on my jumper the next day and projection is okay at about 1 foot but it does linger for a while. 

**Overall: 7/10**

___


**Pennine For Men 1008 (PdM Carlisle)**

I have very mixed emotions with this one. It was quite hyped up especially from YouTubers online such as FragMental. I‚Äôm not a massive fan of the almond note in this and the whole scent as a whole is probably my least favourite PP that I‚Äôve bought. The scent is quite strong and does develop further in the dry down with a lot more patchouli but I can‚Äôt get past the initial spray. I‚Äôve also received mixed reviews for this frag from friends as some don‚Äôt like it but others love it. 

The performance was great I could smell this all day for over 8 hours and projection was good as well at 1 to 2 feet for hours. 

**Overall: 5/10**

___


**Final Comments:**
I‚Äôve ordered many Perfume Parlour clones and I‚Äôve been happy with the majority of them. PP is even much cheaper than decants and because of that I‚Äôve been able to experiment and try different fragrances at a fraction of the price. I will be ordering more from PP soon however I think the next purchase for me will be Ultra Male. This is one of my favourite PP scents to date and it‚Äôs convinced me to get a full bottle of the real thing. 

I‚Äôve learnt that although I enjoy the smell of darker, more dense fragrances such as Pure Havane, Noir de Noir, Tuscan Leather and By The Fireplace; I don‚Äôt think I can pull them off. I feel much more confident and enjoy myself wearing more fresh and clean - ‚Äúshower gel‚Äù type fragrances. I will be keeping the bottles I have so far and wear them every so often but the more citrus and sweet scents are what I really enjoy. 

I‚Äôm not sure on what my next order, I am open to suggestions, however I‚Äôm interested in getting PP‚Äôs Aventus clone ‚ÄúAvalanche Woody 1848‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure which of their Aventus clones is best so if anyone has any experience with any of them and their opinions I‚Äôd love to hear them!",2020-12-17 01:20:00
Perfumes,"[Chez Pierre] New Fragrances arrival, New Limited Edition Bottles arrival, etc..","Hello, guys Perfume Guy here,

So today I want to announce a few things:

1: New Fragrance Arrival

3: Cosmetics

4: Question for the community

# 1: New Fragrance Arrival

# 2: New Limited Edition Bottles

So a lot of customers requested better-looking bottles.

 We decided to listen to them and we got test quantity for these specific ones [https://imgur.com/a/gIudAgf](https://imgur.com/a/gIudAgf)

300 of these will be available until they go out of stock.

They are available in 55ml and 75ml.

As a lot of people request, we will look to import better-looking ones in March/April (we are deciding now which ones to take) so in the future, glass bottles will be fancier ones!

If you have any suggestions about new bottles, I would love to hear that!

# 3: Cosmetics

Always wanted to get a gift for a family next to the perfumes?

Well, now the cosmetic section is available on the website!

Shipping is a flat rate so if you take perfumes, you can take them too for the same shipping price.

Did I mention prices are also fair and not high?

Check out cosmetics now: [https://shop.chezpierre.rs/cosmetics](https://shop.chezpierre.rs/cosmetics)

From bath bombs to car fresheners to cream perfumes, we have all available!

# 4: Question for the community

Could you please give me overall feedback?

What should I fix, what should I improve, what should I add, etc..

Something that I have in mind is:

\-candles that are inspired by famous perfumes

\-Tester of paper that holds perfume so I can ship a few of them in every order!

If you have any idea, please share it and it might happen in 2021!

Thank you so much for the support, I appreciate it!

Much love,

Perfume Guy

The reason I‚Äôm specific with the comparison is not only because of my nostalgic attachment, but also because I‚Äôm quite new to the world of perfume and notes and the like, so I‚Äôm not sure if waterlily could possibly smell different when in different perfumes...

Perfumes,Looking for a perfume with fig leaf,Hi! I was wondering if anyone could help me find a perfume with fig leaf? I‚Äôm from the uk and I had ordered some shoes from a boutique from Japan. The seller sprayed some perfume on the card she left me and it was the best thing I have ever smelt in my life! I asked her where I could get it and she said it‚Äôs only available in Thailand but it is not allowed to post liquid perfume from there :( devastated and I cannot find it anywhere! I really hope someone can help. If it helps the perfume was fig leaf and almond x,2020-12-29 07:16:14

Perfumes,OMG Please help me name this awful note so I can avoid it!,"There is a base note that I have come to HATE. So far, I have found that it is in Carolina Herrera Good Girl and Burberry Her London Dream. It's so strong, I can hardly stand it. To me, it smells overwhelmingly like antiseptic alcohol and men's cologne. Perhaps someone in my life wore an after shave this reminds me of (?) There's little crossover in the notes listed in the marketing of each fragrance: just ""amber"". Of course, that could be anything üòí

Does anyone wear either of these fragrances, and do you know what it might be?",2020-12-29 08:11:02

Perfumes,Perfume that smells of warmth and decadent sweets?,"Hi all,

First time here in this sub. I‚Äôve been on the search for a long lasting, good-quality, perfume. With COVID, I can‚Äôt (and don‚Äôt want to) test any scents in stores nor go to stores unless it‚Äôs a necessity.
With that said, my taste in scents is warm and sweet, but with some woody, sandalwood aspects.

I love the Soap and Glory body spray, ‚ÄúSmoothie Star‚Äù:

‚ÄúThis sweet, nutty gourmand fragrance is filled with mouthwatering almonds, hazelnut and citrus, on a heart of maple syrup and vanilla. The fragrance leaves a delicious finish of sandalwood and amber.‚Äù


I also am in love with Lush‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Home‚Äù:


‚ÄúFrom the bottle, I'm Home offers two very distinctive notes - a sweet, musky layer of vanilla, and a rich, powdery sprinkling of cocoa absolute. The latter is very robust from the get-go and almost blankets the vanilla slightly - offering a smell that reminds me of an expensive vanilla ice cream decorated with a generous sprinkling of cocoa powder or hot, dark chocolate sauce.‚Äù


I also love men‚Äôs colognes scents. The crisp, sharp smells that are clean and green and shmexy. If there is something out there that I should know about along these lines, please share.



Thank you all and stay safeüñ§",2020-12-30 06:16:28

Perfumes,Suggestions for something similar to Louis Vuitton‚Äôs Attrape-R√™ves,"‚ÄúMaster Perfumer Jacques Cavallier Belletrud imagines a trail like a shower of shooting stars, where raw cocoa powder mingles with a bouquet of peonies. Then comes the patchouli heart, enlivened by litchi‚Äôs fresh and sparkling notes.‚Äù

Clinique‚Äôs Cocoa and Cashmere comes to mind because of the cocoa, but other than that, it‚Äôs not really the same at all. 

Any suggestions that keep me from buying the full size LV bottle are greatly appreciated!!",2020-12-31 02:36:19
