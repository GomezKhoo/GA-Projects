Makeup,Friend “tried” all of my lipsticks.,"I had a friend approach over and while she was in the bathroom she said she tried all of my lipsticks out to see what shade she liked best. She said she used a cotton swab but there’s only one cotton swab used and she said she sampled roughly 5 or 6 different lip sticks, meaning that she used the same cotton swab to apply every lipstick that she put on. She commonly gets cold sores but doesn’t have an active one right now. The ‏‏‎ majority of the lip sticks are liquid ones with applicators that go back into the tube so I can’t use alcohol to sterilize. Do I need to throw these out? It’s at least $80 worth of makeup.",2022-07-24 16:37:57

Makeup,Morphe 35O Dupes? Looking to re-fill my Z Palette.,"My well loved 35O palette has officially met its demise. There were some shadows cracking and some I never used, so I tried de-potting and re-potting into a Z Palette (to some success). I went on vacation, didn't pack the Z Palette correctly and the shadows are now a powdery mess.

I loved the shades in the 35O, so I'm looking to find some great quality single shadow dupes that can go in the Z Palette that are the same shades from the 35O. I'm already looking through Colourpop, but I can't seem to pinpoint the colors/formulations. I'm willing to try other brands too. Any recommendations?",2022-07-25 02:52:08

Armani silk foundation but now trying a drop of Ilia skin tint (man that stuff covers sooo much). I use Charlotte T’s airbrush setting powder (Ilia is wayyyy too greasy for me untamed). Im having trouble with blush - it all seems too heavy. This seems to be the most natural look after a few hours but would like suggestions. Are powder foundations better? 

I’ve been playing with lipsticks but they all look too heavy and started back to lip balm. I do Urban Decay eye liner and Honest lash tint. Whenever I wear shadow (with my hooded eyes) it looks heavy…. I have a few palettes from Urban Decay and Chanel. I want to look natural - but my skin imperfections make it hard to not wear anything.

Makeup,Should tinted moisturiser be set with powder?,"I got the Laura Mercier oil free tinted moisturiser recently which has great reviews. It’s my first tinted moisturiser so I don’t have any other experience with them &amp; I guess I saw it differently to foundation &amp; thought the point was it was meant to be low maintenance &amp; you just put it on &amp; go, treating it like I would wearing moisturiser. But I was a total oil slick in an hour or two &amp; it looked terrible.

Should I be wearing it the same way I wear foundation, setting it with powder &amp; also using primer/fixing spray if needed? And whilst I’m on the subject should I also be putting my normal moisturiser on first, or is this meant to moisturise adequately alone?

I guess I’m disappointed as that doesn’t seem any less effort than wearing foundation is, but maybe that’s my own mistake for expecting that from it &amp; the only difference is meant to be that it’s more lighter &amp; natural looking? Though that just makes me think I can get the same effect by using less of my normal foundation &amp; more sheered out or even mixed in with my moisturiser.",2022-07-25 21:56:28

Makeup,Boyfriend looking for Purchase Recommendations?,"Hi everybody, hopefully I'm in the right subreddit or can get sent there by one of you!

So my partner is pretty hard to shop for and experiences an amount of ""gift anxiety"" (feelings of ""I don't deserve this/it's too nice for me/buying me stuff is a waste"") that makes gift giving even trickier, but recently we were at a Winners and came across some of what I think are called palettes? They're little packs with 12 to 16 different coloured squares of makeup that seem to be used for eyeshadow. And apparently they were exciting enough that I was allowed to buy one as a gift! Which was something I haven't experienced before with this partner because again, there's a lot of negative/guilty emotions around gift giving that I'm always kind of running up against. 

The three total we wound up with were called **Rude x Koi Footwear Boots Collection - Helios Hologram Flame Boots, Rude x Koi Footwear Boots Collection - Lozo Green Rain Boots** and **BH Cosmetics Avocado Toast Shadow Palette** and all three have been super popular already.

Anyway, now that I seem to have an outlet to express my gift giving affection I'd like to learn more about what would be worth buying in the future. I have very little understanding of makeup but I can give some rough notes about my partner;

Winged eyeliner, mascara and eyeshadow is pretty common but lipstick apparently comes across ""trashy"" a lot of the time (I guess because it's a bit dolled up or showy or something?) and the general vibe is pretty alternative, punk, probably goth but I have to be a bit careful with that because I have kind of a known goth girl dating history and it would maybe land wrong as a gift if it seemed like I was pressuring my current partner to dress up as previous partners/flings/etc. Aside from that, not much for coverup/foundation/etc., it's mostly all just... eyework? Is that what you call it?

The palettes are getting a ton of use but from reading online it seems like these are maybe like, ""cheap"" ones or entry level or sort of frugal? I try to equate it with stuff I know like coffee or car parts where you can buy higher grade stuff for a better experience, I assume it's similar here? Are there higher quality palettes that still have the fun alt kind of vibes? 

Aside from that for mascara or eyeliner we seem to usually just wind up with whatever is at Walmart or the pharmacy - usually that Elf brand stuff. I don't know if Elf is fine, I think every girl I've ever dated had some of that in their bathroom, but again connecting to what I am familiar with, Wal-Mart coffee or engine oil isn't really something I'd go in for.

Budget is basically whatever, I'm sure there are like ten thousand dollar kits or whatever that would make me feel silly for saying that but these were super cheap and I'd be happy spending more to get better stuff to use. I'm also down for any kind of links for reading or whatever so I can understand what I'm doing better and not buy pointless stuff, if anyone has any of that?

Thanks in advance, everybody!",2022-07-26 05:21:00
Makeup,Misprint or knock-off?,"I have been trying so hard to find a review of this one lipstick that I bought from my local beauty store because it's on sale. But I found none.

Now I think this might have happened because the products are on sale so maybe it's a product that had misprints or has been on the shelf for too long (I have no idea how any of these works).

Makeup,Ilia Super Serum Skin Tint VS. Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer Natural Skin Perfector,"I’ve recently purchased both of these products while looking for an alternative to foundation.  I really love both products and they seem to look the same on me, so I don’t need to keep both of them but can’t decide which to return/keep. They both have similar ratings on EWG but different flagged ingredients (see below) so I’m trying to determine if one is better/safer than the other in that regard but I don’t know much about skincare chemicals but I’m pregnant and want to keep it as clean as I can.

Ilia pros are that it has a light, smooth coverage with SPF 40. Cons are that it smells awful and has zinc oxide (12%).

Laura Mercier pros are that it also has a light smooth coverage but no detectable scent. Cons are that the SPF 30 is lower than Ilia’s and it contains oxybenzone (1%).

Makeup,Eyelash extensions rant,"I’m not sure if this was the right sub to post in and if this is technically makeup but I’ve been getting eyelash extensions for 7 years now. Before those 7 years I wore lash strips for 3 years. I’ve always hated the way I look without lashes since my real lashes are very small and don’t curl (I have Asian lashes). The thing with extensions is I can just wake up and feel pretty, go swimming and still look good and even cry and not be totally disgusted by the way I look after. My boyfriend has only ever known me with my extensions too. 

The place I’ve been going for the past 7 years have raised their prices from 60$ to 90$ for a fill. And on top of that they’re shortening the time from 3 weeks to 2 weeks?? It seems so unreasonable and just greedy. I’m in college now and can’t afford that extra raise. (Plus I drive an hour to the salon since it’s located in my hometown). 

I’ve tried to look at new salons near me but I’m in the city so their prices are the same if not more expensive. And I have thought about just cutting off but these extensions have really given me more confidence in myself. Also I love just waking up and being ready to go. I’m debating to have my boyfriend learn how to do them and just buying lash kits online.

Im just pissed at how expensive they are now. I would drive all the way home because how cheap they were compared to the city but now they’re just as expensive as here.",2022-07-27 04:30:56

Makeup,Makeup Wipe Rec Needed,"I don't use makeup wipes regularly since I prefer the deep and gentle clean of an oil / balm remover. Most of the time my makeup is incredibly minimal - just spot concealing. So the whole process of going through the massaging, the emulsifying, and the rinsing can feel a bit overbearing. At those times I wipe off the makeup using a micellar water and a cotton pad. Which is fine when I'm at home.   


But for travel (especially on days when I spending the night at someone's house), I wouldn't mind the ease of a one step wipe to remove my minimal makeup. Of course I would cleanse afterwards. I wouldn't do this often since wipes can seem wasteful and harsh on the skin. But in a pinch it seems like a good product to have. Makeup balms / oils can kinda gunk up the sink so I feel horrible about doing that to another person's sink. What makeup wipes would you recommend?",2022-07-27 05:20:44

But upon reading the features of this make up. This kind of looks good and is very helpful. Knowing Kylie Jenner's brand of make up she's received a lot of hate for it but i think it's normal to any brand that's starting. so i guess im just gonna give it a try but what do you guys think? for those who have tried it/currently using it?

Makeup,lipstick recommendations for an overwhelmed person,"hi! so im new to makeup but i do like a little color on my lips and im particularly interested with this popular look of korean style lips; i love how soft and kind of 'natural' the lips look

doing research ive seen they mostly use lip stains i cant find at ulta (and the ones they have are a bit expensive). it seems liquid lipstick would kind of work for the look by applying the lipstick with your fingers and blotting it, but i am scared bc liquid lipstick has always been my enemy as i have dry lips and it makes me look like a clown (not used to seeing me with obvious makeup)

so my questions is, is there a liquid lipstick that i could be able to blot on my lips without it becoming patchy and that doesnt desintegrate if i put vaseline on top to hydrate my lips?",2022-07-27 07:04:58

Makeup,How do y'all manage to do your makeup so quickly?,"Days ago, I got downvoted for saying that it takes me 70 minutes to do a simple makeup look. Not sure why I got downvoted, but no matter how hard I try, I can never do a full face of makeup in under an hour.

Mascara is my longest step, because my lashes won't curl unless I curl them at least 5 times each, and since my lashes as less than a centimeter long, I have to apply mascara slowly, or else I'll get it all over my eye area.

Foundation/concealer is my second longest step, because I have acne all over my face, so I use full-coverage foundation and it take forever to blend, and even after I blend it, some don't fully cover, so I have to apply some concealer over them then blend them out with my finger.

Eyeliner is my least favorite step, because it takes forever to make both sides look even.

Even blush and bronzer take me some time, because it also struggle to make both sides of my face look even.

I also wear primer, eyebrow powder, eyeshadow (usually just 2 or 3 colors), lashes, lipstick, and setting spray which adds even more time.

And if I were to do a full-glam look, that'll take me over 2 hours.

So how do you all manage to do your makeup in under an hour? By any chance, does it correspond with your general art skills? I literally can't draw or color anything, so could that be why I suck at applying makeup?",2022-07-27 23:27:56

It’s been 3-4 days and my vision is fine (eye less sore than before, still slightly sore) but I feel like something is different. I feel sort of uncomfortable or that my vision’s changed - or I’m either just overthinking. I’m not sure if it was my falsies poking my eye or glue mightve gone into my eye?

I’m worried I messed up my vision or that there is a bigger issue. Could someone give me some insight? I’m very worried.",2022-07-28 09:43:50

Makeup,Fake lashes look weird on me,"I’ve tried so many different styles and I can’t find lashes that suit my eyes. For context I am mixed Hispanic/Asian and my eyes are round, a little downturned, and my bottom eyelids are really puffy. I also have really hooded eyes. I love the way lashes look on other people, but my eyes always look puffy and weird and bug-eyed when I put on lashes. 

What am I doing wrong? I’ve heard people say to try cat-eye styles to suit round eyes but those look weird on me too. Should I just stick with mascara?",2022-07-28 13:05:03
Makeup,soap brows/clear brow gel tips/techniques?,"i’ve recently started using clear brow gel to do my brows because i like how flat they get, the strong hold, and the way the hairs flare out. i’ve been using the elf clear brow pomade because i’m cheap lol. 

the issue i’ve noticed is that it doesn’t ever really dry down and feels sticky all the time, especially when i sweat. which carries it to other parts of my face and makes it sticky, or makes my hands sticky when i accidentally touch them. 

am i supposed to use translucent powder after? or will that make them look cakey. should i actually be using soap instead? or maybe hair gel? please &amp; thank you &lt;3",2022-07-28 14:16:51

Makeup,What do use for a quick makeup look?,"I’m interested to find out what everyone does when it’s a running out the door moment. I have two kids and have to do it a lot so I’m curious about techniques and products!



My “mom makeup” routine:


Toner (I don’t wash my face in the morning), moisturizer and a primer. I use a lot of different ones but current favorite is CoverGirl Outlast Stay All Day Primer. 


Next is Hollywood Flawless Filter by Charlotte Tilbury, it hides a lot of texture. I put that on my face along with ELF Hydrating Camo Concealer and blend. You can see my skin but I still have coverage. Set with Maybelline SuperStay Powder Foundation. 


Then Laura Gellar Balance ‘N Brighten Bronzer and I use either Benefit Dallas blush or Hourglass diffused heat (sometimes both.) Then blend. If I’m feeling like it I use Ciate Dewy Sticks. 


Then brows, I’m pretty blessed with nice brows but they are bleach blonde and I currently have dark hair. I fill them in with a Maybelline brow pencil and then Gimme Brow. 


If I’m really in a rush I stop there although sometimes I’ll put on mascara. Otherwise I use three shadows: a matte brown for the crease, black to line the upper lash line and a highlight. I really like Milani Bold Obsessions for that but I use the Kaja stack in Chocolate Dahlia a lot too. Often use Benefit Dallas in my crease. Then Essence Doll Lash mascara and whatever setting spray I have laying around. 


Sounds like a lot but it never takes more than 10 minutes. What do you use?!?",2022-07-28 16:04:40

I am mostly interested in every day make up and natural make up, for that reason I prefer drugstore brands. Let me know if you have any products to recommend! I have a very fair skin (I always get the lightest shades they have) if that helps, oh and I’m in UK if that matters, I noticed a lot of the stuff sold in US is either unavailable here or costs much more.

Makeup,Foundation that stays but doesn’t look Cakey,"Hi y’all!!! I’m on a hunt for a foundation that will stay, doesn’t look cakey and still looks natural. I have been using Bare Minerals in Light Ivory for the last year. Love it but it photographs horribly on me. I am a redhead so I have many freckles that take up most of my face. The foundation looks like it seperates on my skin and is streaky. 

I have been torn between Two Faced Born this way, as I used it before. Or Fenty. I live in the southern region of the US, so humidity is a constant struggle. As well, as finding one’s that don’t have a pink undertone in my light shade.

There isn’t any pain or itchiness. It can’t be an allergic reaction, I’ve used the liner several times no issue. So I thought I’d ask anyone who experienced this what they did to ease the swelling?

Makeup,Need Advice and Recommendations please!,"So I really am not skilled at all with my makeup. I only wear it occasionally. But I'm looking to try to improve my techniques. I know that begins with skincare, and I have type 2 rosacea. So I know my basics of 1)Cleanse 2) Moisture 3) Sunscreen. Could I please have recommendations for a decent, drugstore/inexpensive foundation? Currently, I'm using Maybelline Super Stay Full Coverage, and while it says full coverage, I still find myself having to use more than I'd like to cover up my redness. Furthermore, I find it leaves me looking over all super dry, which I do prefer a matte look, but I don't like the cakey look it gives me. Perhaps I need to look for a better primer? I know a green tinted one is good for rosacea, does anyone have a recommendation for a good green tinted one that has nice smoothing and adhering qualities, but wont necessarily break the bank? Also, when I try to blend my contour, I find doing so wipes away my foundation, and then my uneven texture and redness shows through?

Makeup,Stash or Trash? Monthly Makeup Routine Recap,"[Pictures are available on my profile, if you are interested!]


COMMENT 1:
--------------------- 

💄 Monthly Makeup Routine Review Recap • July, '22 

...... 

➡️ NOTE: the information contained within this post is based upon my research, opinions, and experience. As always, buy/use the products that make YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored nor quid pro quo. I do it for fun. NO FILTERS OR EDITS USED IN MY PICTURES, EVER. 

...... 

🧐 PURPOSE: every month I'm shopping my stash for a REASONABLE amount of products from each makeup category. Over the course of the month, I'm going to really get to learn about each product in-depth, and eventually relay to you - the findings. During this process, I'm also figuring out which products I'm completely decluttering from my collection. 

...... 

🔹️POTENTIAL PROCESS QUESTIONS: 


+ Total Products This Month: 23
+ Total Products I'm Keeping: 19
+ Total Products I'm Decluttering: 4
+ Total Products 'COMPLETELY' Finished: 0
+ Total Products 'ALMOST' Finished: 2
+ % of Routine Finished/Decluttered: 26% 


• DECLUTTERED PRODUCTS: will be placed in a special box for the time being as I collect more, but I intend on gathering a few more over time, and selling (the ones I paid for) as a bundle for solely the cost of shipping on my boutique. The products that I got for free (or don't have time to list) will be bundled together and I will hold a bundle giveaway for people who don't mind (sanitized) secondhand products used only by me. 


• PROS OF THIS SYSTEM: significant product knowledge, ability to get intensively creative with products, easy to manage such a small grouping of products, no hard decisions on what makeup to wear every day, means to actually use up products (or make a pretty big dent)


• CONS OF THIS SYSTEM: boredom (I got notably bored at the three-week mark), if something you pick really sucks - you have to explore ways to make it work in other capacities, sadness of potentially decluttering something you spent a lot of money on if it doesn't perform 

......

Makeup,Why is waterproof makeup so hard to work with?,"So I've been using the Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation for a long time but it looks horrendous on me. I've tried a lot of different combinations of different skincare and primers, and nothing seems to make it actually look good. The only reason I keep purchasing it, is because I'm extremely pale and the 0n1 Alabaster shade is the closest thing to my skin tone that I can find. I use it with the Fenty pro filt'r Hydrating Primer(soft silk) and that seems to make it work.. somewhat. My problem is that the foundation sets so fast, I don't even have time to blend it in properly and it gets very patchy. And god forbid I try to apply a second layer, it always(!) removes the first layer completely. I am thinking it could have to do with their bases? The Double Wear seems to be water/silicone based, but... the Fenty Primer is also? Maybe it has to do with the Hyaluronic Acid I use? I figured it might cling onto the water in the foundation and make it stick on some parts faster than others. Especially since I use a damp beauty blender. But some other foundations that are silicone based work like wonders, for ex. Maybelline Fit me matte and poreless(way too dark for me tho). I don't even need a primer for that. It's only the waterproof formulas that are so hard to work with.

Should you use the Double Wear Foundation with a brush instead of a damp beauty blender? Do I need a different primer? Do I need to use skincare with oils on my face? I honestly don't know what  I am doing wrong anymore..

Btw I have the same problem with the Sheglam 12-Hr-Concealer and Nyx Cant stop wont stop concealer. They all seem to be this waterproof/water-resistant formula. I tried mixing water into it and it just immediately sticks to my skin like glue and cannot be spread/blended in. I'm also looking into Revolution Conceal and Define Foundation, does anyone know if it's the same waterproof formula? It says oil-free so I'm a bit scared lol

For skincare I use different products with HA but nothing with oils(I have very oily dehydrated skin).",2022-07-29 21:29:43

Makeup,What do you do with all makeup you have bought but doesn’t suit you/you never use,"Hi everyone! This is my first post here, hope it will be clear ;)

I buy many products, I must admit, especially in the Sephora stores or online. When i buy makeup online 9/10 the colors are completely different as pictured on the store online (AND THIS PISSES ME OFF SO MUCH, even though i checked the swatches!) or the quality is slightly off than expected or idk… some other reasons.

At this point, I have a bunch of makeup (eye palettes, face products, blushes, bronzers…) that i simply don’t use and don’t know any friend that could use it. I don’t want to throw it away, it’s new… what do you guys would do?",2022-07-29 21:52:38

So. Knowing that I'm not really that insecure with my facial skin. Can't I just wear eye makeup? (And also, some nose contouring to give shape to my flat nose).

Like completely ditch primers and foundation, just eyeliner, mascara, contour, and boom. Off to class/work.

Makeup,nonprofit looking for places to purchase bulk makeup for LGBTQ+ transwomen/femmes,"Hi, I help run a nonprofit that specializes in providing HIV risk reduction for LGBTQ+ individuals through a variety of service programs. One of the programs we run is specifically designed for transwomen/femmes. Many of our participants are recently out as trans, are unhoused, or are living in low-income environments. Gender affirming care, clothing, and supplies are one of the services this program provides to assist women with their self-esteem, thriving in their environment, and to live as their authentic selves. As such, one of the groups we run is all about transition options (both social and medical options), but the facilitators will also provide makeup lessons to those who are interested. 

We would love to supply makeup to participants that attend group so they can live their best lives, but what is a good place for us to buy makeup in bulk? I have been looking, but due to us being a 501(c)3, we are at the mercy of our grant funding so we unfortunately don't have a lot to spend. Thank you!",2022-07-30 01:21:59
Makeup,My bridal MUA deleted all posts from her Insta. Now I feel a bit underwhelmed about booking her.,"I booked a celebrity makeup artist for my wedding in November. She did two of my friends and my cousins wedding make up and it was flawless! She is a master at her craft. Now I thought that I too like my cousins and friends will get to show off my makeup look and my outfits and my designers etc through her page. I spent the last whole year curating and putting together. She has over 300k followers on Instagram. 
Today I checked her profile to discuss some of her makeup looks that I had saved. on Instagram with my sisters. I was shocked to find that she has deleted all her posts and reels from her page. When I asked her where her bridal posts went. She said she deleted them for religious reasons. 

I just suddenly feel weird and underwhelmed about the whole thing. I mean if I had to keep it on the down low I could have hired a normally good MUA and not a celebrity one. I hired a celebrity MUA at those rates for a certain vibe. But now I feel that from her when she doesn’t want to show any brides on her page. 

I didn’t discuss it with her cz I respect her religious sentiments. 

I can still cancel her but I have many mutual acquaintances with her . Nothing too close or major. 

Should I keep her or cancel her?",2022-07-30 01:38:40

Makeup,Makeup settling and texture,"I need some help with my foundation technique. I find that even after giving my Moisturizer and primer time to settle in, when I go to apply my concealer and foundation, it settles into my pores as I am applying, and gets a separated look straight away. No matter if I apply and try to blend in with a damp beauty blender, or dab on with my fingers gently. I just cannot get a smooth or even application. I have roscea, and the skin of my cheeks is quite red, but i feel like when I'm smoothing in my primer, I get it feeling smooth enough, but then boom, foundation application proves me wrong. I use a CeraVe Moisturizer, Elf Poreless Face primer, Covergirl Trueblend Undercover concealer, and Maybelline SuperStay Active Wear foundation. Also, no matter if I use primer, setting spray or what, foundation NEVER wants to stay on my nose. I have an oily nose, but I feel like with my skincare, shouldn't that be helping it not be so oily? I go to apply foundation on my nose, a Tap it on with my damp sponge, the product sits there, then when I tap it more to blend into my skin, instead it just disappears. Then, I'll try to cover up that uneven application by dabbing foundation onto my nose, but even then I have to use the absolute faintest pressure, or it will rub right off again. Please, please help if you have tips :(",2022-07-30 03:13:45

Makeup,The new Benefit gimme brow volumizing pencils - has anyone heard ~anything~ about these or tried them out? What's the deal with them?,"So Benefit kinda just suddenly launched a new brow pencil that's supposed to be volumizing and have fibers and stuff - apparently it's all very innovative in the brow pencil domain.

I've kind of wanted to hear people's thoughts on them because I'm intrigued but not sure if it's worth the hype or if it's just another brow pencil. I'm also pretty curious about the shades because the blonde ones look very light in the photos, especially compared to their other pencils. But I can't find anything about them - no YT videos, it doesn't look like they sent them out via influenster so there's no pictures in the reviews, instagram search is pretty useless, and I'm not on TikTok. I can't tell if they're an online only item or if my nearest Ulta store just hasn't gotten them yet.

Makeup,"In your opinion, is it possible to have a polished makeup look without using concealer/primer/foundation? How do you do a ""full face"" of makeup without them?","I usually just do light eyeliner, mascara, and eyebrow makeup. I like to experiment with highlighter, eyeshadow, or lip products, but I've never gone out with it since my sister says it looks unfinished/unpolished. I never use any skin products like concealer, primer, or foundation due to both personal preference (I prefer a minimalist look) and because I have skin reactions to most skin products. 

So, I am looking to find a way to do a so-called ""full face"" of makeup without skin products. And by full face I mean: eyeshadow, mascara, eyebrow pen, cream eyeshadow, lip tint, and maybe highlighter. But, I don't know how to do it without looking 'incomplete' or 'unpolished'.

Any suggestions on how I could achieve this look and still look polished, or is it impossible to do without skin products?

Makeup,Concealing lower lashline darkness,"I feel like this is not a common problem because when I look for it, nothing comes up. I don't really have dark circles, just a vein under my eye that I conceal a little, but my lower lashline area is very dark/discolored like bags would be. I've watched a lot of videos and tutorials where concealing is done, but they never go right up under the eye and into the lashline. 

My eyelashes are very dark ask well and thick, so they cast a shadow and emphasize the discoloration more. 

Do you think I'm perhaps seeing an issue that isn't really there? Or does anyone else have this? I can't even use a shadow under my eye like everyone does because it looks silly on me. I look tired.

What I usually do is conceal all the way into the lower lashline and then I use a brightening liner in the waterline. As soon as I remove this, I look like a vampire.",2022-07-30 12:07:08

Makeup,Looking for Recs Similar to It Cosmetics CC Cream,"Hi there! I’ve been using IT Cosmetic’s CC Cream in Matte for the last few years and I still like it but I also wonder what else is there now that there’s so much more available on the market sooo things I like:
It’s super buildable so I usually only use about a pump and a half for my whole face to apply a thin layer that evens out my skin tone while still allowing freckles and beauty marks to show through. It doesn’t actually dry down matte, but it’s more matte than the original. 
What I don’t like:
Sometimes, it feels too thick- which I guess could be remedied with a face oil? But it just feels like adding in an extra step that might break down the product. 
I’ve used Nars Skin Tint and Laura Mercier’s tinted moisturizer in the past, but I didn’t like how oily they made my skin feel.

👉 Urban Decay - Eyeshadow Primer Potion 

// 

THOUGHTS: There are a few certain 'preferences' I MUST have in an eye primer - I prefer a 'cream-to-powder' dry-down, I need a primer that completely blanks out the entire eye area for a clean canvas, and I also want something that completely flattens-out the surface. I find that without the proper priming base,  eyeshadow nearly never blends properly on my eyes. This particular eyeshadow primer is iconic, but oddly enough - I've never tried it. 

I discovered that it's very easy to apply, as it comes with a handy, plush doefoot applicator that carries an adequate amount of product. I applied as much as I normally would, and blended it out with a brush. I found it a bit tough to see exactly where I had applied it due to its colorless base. After a minute or two, I felt a legitimate tightening of my eyelid as it fully dried. I suffer from pretty bad eyelid discoloration, and it didn't do very much to cover that. 

As far as performance - at NO point did this primer crease on me, which is atypical. I found that the eyeshadows I applied on top blended-out perfectly, and the primer did indeed, mend my dry patches so the shadows stick.

👉 E.L.F. Cosmetics - Powder Foundation 

// 

THOUGHTS: As a super-hyped product, I was so excited to try this! I only 'sometimes' use a powdered-foundation, and I've always appreciated the ease-of-use. I began with a fully prepped face - including a pore-filling primer. This specific foundation product comes with an application sponge for on-the-go, but I chose to apply it with a buffing brush (Sigma F80 Flat Kabuki). 

I'll say, it didn't take me long to get completely full-coverage, and dude - do I ever LOVE it. I had to use quite a bit of the powder to get my desired look (essentially, the 'E.L.F. logo is almost dissolved in the powder) but it is so worth it. My skin looks amazing! The foundation covered up every single area-of-concern, in the most beautiful way. My face didn't look heavy, cakey, or powdery at all. Since it IS afterall, a powder, it felt curiously lightweight and comfortable upon my face. I achieved a very smooth, natural-matte finish. 

I applied both powder AND cream products over the top, and found that both types applied well, without any lifting of the foundation (and making it look patchy). Also, I want to note that I have quite a bit of peach fuzz on my face, and the powder kind of 'sticks to it', so dermaplaning would definitely be a good idea prior to using this.

👉 Rimmel London - High'Light Buttery-Soft Highlighting Powder 

// 

THOUGHTS: I've always heard amazing things about this highlighter, and frankly - I've been intrigued. I know the 'intense highlight' trend is over, but I've never been one to 'follow the rules'. I love all sorts of makeup, not just what the trends are. Rimmel has always been one of my most-favorite drugstore brands, so I had confidence that this would be up to standard. 

It looked fairly golden in the pan, but as I  actually applied it, it really looked more champagne in tone. I decided to apply this in a diffused manner, with a fluffy brush. It applied so very smoothly, with a seamless application (absolutely no barrier lines). On my skin, it's my favorite type of highlight. It has a barely visible base with tiny, sparkly mica particles pieced all-around. I think it looks gorgeous, and still illuminates your skin without being extra-audacious.

👉 Maybelline - Tattoo Studio Brow Lift Stick 

// 

THOUGHTS: I've been dying to try this product since it released, so I couldn't be more excited! This product is supposed to mindlessly give you that purposeful 'laminated brow' look. The component itself is unlike any other brow product I've ever used. The wax part is intentionally less-pigmented to only 'lightly tint' the brows. The opposite end holds a unique plastic brush and laminating tool. 

As for application - first, I brushed up my brows with a spoolie. Then I drew the wax tint over my entire brow shape. I put enough on, as to where I believed I would get a decent hold. I then used the opposite end to brush the wax evenly throughout, and then the flat-side to push them flush against my face. 

In the end, my brows maintained a nice, tinted, feathered-effect, but the wax itself wasn't strong enough to truly give them the 'professionally laminated' style. I personally like the product myself and will use it a lot, but would not recommend this to somebody looking for this as perfection (in lieu of the professional craft).

👉 Kaleidos - Quad Palette 

// 

THOUGHTS: Kaleidos is my FAVORITE high-end makeup brand, so I feel compelled to try something from each launch. To put it plainly - I absolutely, positively, 100%, LOVED how this performed. 

This is what I look for in an every day palette. I love the ratio of mattes to shimmers. The formulations of both types of shadows are on target with other products they've previously released. This palette performs extremely high in quality, and produces a simplistic (yet dimensional) eye look. I did experience a decent amount of kick-back and fall-out as I used this. Although this is a 'neutral eye quad', you can do a lot of fun stuff with this due to its marvelous gradient-effect. 

The only thing that makes this eye quad not 'perfect', is that the shade names (nor the palette name) are not printed on the palette itself - they are located on a separate plastic insert that must be kept if you want to retain the information. As far as its peerless performance - I am most certainly impressed.

👉 By Terry - Terrybly Velvet Rouge Liquid Velvet Lipstick 

// 

THOUGHTS: I haven't have tried much from this brand, and I figured a liquid lipstick would make for a good start. Right upon opening - this has a VERY strong rose-scent (which I do not prefer). The applicator is a circular, plush hourglass shape, which should aid in precision application without the necessity of an additional lip liner. 

I found this to be extremely easy to apply. The formula is very thin, so it needs to be built-up for its full opacity. I love how it looks overall - it's a liquid lipstick that doesn't dry my lips out and showcase every single line. When I rub my lips together, it truly has a velvet-like feeling. This is a super-comfortable formula for every day wear. However, it DOES transfer! 

Lastly, this particular liquid lipstick is NOT for those that avoid fragrance; I can heavily smell and taste this upon my lips. The scent lasts the entirety of wear-time.

Makeup,Help finding the right eyebrow product,"Hi everyone, I have very sparse brows (basically next to nothing), so doing my eyebrows definitely are a huge part of my makeup routine. Currently I use a brow pencil to essentially draw on my brows, but I was wondering if I should make the switch to a brow powder since I’ve read that it gives a more natural brow, and I personally prefer a more natural makeup style. What’s the comparison between these products for someone with sparse brows?",2022-06-25 12:01:11
Makeup,How to avoid cakey melting under eye (but also full face) makeup?,"I have very oily sensitive skin and I’m also currently in California so it’s been extremely hot. When I do my makeup in the morning on my under eye area I just use concealer that I set with a finishing powder. For the rest of my face I use a light cushion foundation that I also set with the same transparent finishing powder. Within about an hour or two my entire face is a cakey creasing mess and my under eye area is completely muddy and creased, especially if I’m wearing eyeshadow of any kind, cream or powder. 

I’m not sure what to do, since I have horribly oily skin I feel like I need to use finishing powder but I also feel like that contributes to the cakeyness. Setting spray also seems to have no effect. What am I doing wrong?",2022-06-25 12:05:20

Makeup,Which Powder over suncreen?,"Well, hello. Didn't think I ever would set foot in these types of forums but here I am. (Nothing bad intended). I am guy who over the year developed acne but has it under control. I learnt much through my journey and one of the things I learned was that sunscreen is the number one ingredient to combat aging. As I am 18 years old and already started sunscreen on daily basis I think I have a bright future in that aspect.

However, the sunscreen i like and use leaves a good shiny finish. I don't like that and would like to counter it somehow. Got some tips about powder and my first intention was that I would never start makeup. But, in reality, it isn't that weird. 

So, do you have any powders as I have no experience in this area. Any tips are welcome!",2022-06-25 23:45:44

Palettes are very fun and convenient because you get so many different shades of shadows in one place, but sometimes you only need ONE specific color and not the entire palette. So does anyone have any ideas which brands or stores carry individual shadows?",2022-06-26 00:03:06

Makeup,Fuss-less mascaras and dark undereye cures?,"I am in a total mascara rut and just can't find something to try and wading through drugstore mascaras is just so hit and miss. I wanted to see if anyone here might be able to suggest something. I'm currently using Saie mascara and it's not bad, I like that it comes off clean but I'd like to try something that gives a little more oomph. Something that comes off clean but won't leave panda eyes since I think I have oily lids? 

The second product I'm looking for I could use some advice on. My undereyes are darker because I've had perpetual sleep problems for years now, and also have deeper natural creases under them. I have really good skin so I don't usually use concealer but the times I have I find it ineffective or too gummy to work with. Is there a good medium coverage concealer or maybe a powder would work better?

If any of y'all have ideas for either of these I'd be so so so grateful. Thanks!",2022-06-26 00:35:15

Makeup,"Having difficulty choosing good shades of eyeshadow (cool summer, deep set eyes)","I have warm hair with cool skin and deep set blue eyes. I guess I'd be considered a cool summer.

Generally speaking, overly warm colors for lipstick or blush seem to be overwhelming. Magentas and cool pinks seem to work pretty well for my skin tone.

My eyes are a different story. Bright warm tones reduce the darkness on my inner eye, but somehow they just seem a little blah. Cool tones make me seem tired, especially if I use them on my inner eye or under my eye.

So far what I've had best luck with brown on my outer eye and golden shimmer on my inner eye. This works, but I'm wondering if there are any other colors that could work well for me.

Is there anything I can do, or am I better off just embracing neutral browns and gold shimmers?",2022-06-26 01:58:34

Makeup,Charlotte Tilbury Question,"So, I'm job hunting in the coming weeks. My field has tons of openings so there's likely going to be several sets of in person interviews (my employer's competitors are all basically in the same geographic location). That said the last time I interviewed I was 25, fresh faced, straight out of grad school, and idealistic. 

Now at 32, I'm in the final stages of a cancer battle (I'm definitely winning), jaded about the job/career field, and just generally more mature skin wise. 

I never really did makeup before but chemo has made me look like death slightly warmed over, so that's going have to change. 

I broke out of my shell and talked to an acquaintance whose makeup I admire and asked if I could buy her coffee and lunch in exchange for a trip to Sephora and Ulta to get some makeup and to help color match some foundation because I can't do it to save my life. She enthusiastically agreed and warned me that makeup, good makeup, wasn't cheap and asked my budget. I gave it to her and this morning we went shopping. 

Now I admit, perhaps I should not have told her my max budget of $300, but I'd done some surfing around and she was right , makeup wasn't cheap, and I had no idea what was good and what wasn't. 

We ended up finding a really good color match with Charlotte Tilbury at Sephora and we built from there. 

All in all we got:
- CT Hollywood Flawless Filter in Fair No. 2
- CT The Queen of Glow Eyeshadow Palette 
- CT Cheek to Chic Swish and Pop Blusher in Ecstasy 
- CT Flimstar Bronze and Glow Contour and Highlighter Palette in Light - Medium
- CT 34 mL Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray
- CT Airbrush Bronzer in Medium No. 2
- Tarte Creaseless Concealer in 10B, fair beige

Total Cost $277 or $39.60ish per item 

So I've gathered Charlotte Tilbury is definitely on the pricier end of makeup, but I was honestly more concerned about the ""look,"" for the first major foray. 

She spent the better part of today picking out makeup with me and and teaching me how to do it. The only thing we didn't do were brows because: 1) my eyebrows need waxed badly, 2) we never found a good shade match, and 3) we ran out of time after six hours. We both had a blast and we agreed to meet up next weekend for brunch so yay for new friends. 

So, I know being a newbie my makeup won't last as long while I figure out the right amounts to dispense &amp; apply, etc., but roughly how fast should I be running through these products if I do M-F makeup application? I might be able to justify the pricing a bit more if the make up lasts longer than it looks in the tiny bottles. Are there any good Charlotte Tilbury dupes in the states? Most of what I've seen has been Primark.",2022-06-26 06:42:41
Makeup,any recommendations on how to keep your eyes from watering?,"I'm unsure if this is a personal medical issue, but this only happens when I apply eye makeup. Doing eye liner is difficult, I have hooded eyes so it usually smudges so to prevent that I go really close to the lash line but it makes my eyes water. The corner of my eyes (where you do 'wings' with eyeliner) is a really vulnerable spot too. Mascara is a hassle to do. Eyeshadow seems to be the safest, but rubs off easily due to my eyelids.

Applying lash adhesive and putting on eyelashes is the most hardest task. my eye shape is more rounded and the eyelashes I use tend to immediately fall off or not apply the right way no matter how hard I try.

I usually tend to avoid makeup tutorials because of my attention span, but if you have simple videos to recommend, much is appreciated.",2022-06-26 06:59:58

...... 

🔺️ ACQUIRED: received in a BoxyCharm, of which I purchased myself

...... 

👁 LOOK CREATED: 'Sunset Eye' 

......

🔊 NOTICE: 

+ At 1.6g, the shadows weigh ABOVE the average amount per pan. I don't think anybody would find difficulty in storing this palette.

...... 

▪️ DESIGNATION: warm color-story 

...... 

▪️ DEXTERITY CONCERNS: none 

...... 

▪️ DESCRIPTION OF SHADE PRESS: soft; recommend doing eyes before base with this palette.

......

• Comparing this palette to similar products available on the market, the price-per-shade is 'extremely excellent'. Additionally - this palette has an 'amazing' cost-per-gram, as compared to other palettes I've previously reviewed. 

...... 

🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️PATCHINESS: none 

🔸️CREASING: yes; almost immediately after look was completed 

🔸️STAINING: none 

🔸️BLENDABILITY: very easy to blend 

🔸️KICK-BACK/FALL-OUT: 


+ the matte shades had an extraordinary level of kick-back, but not the shimmers
+ experienced a ton of fall-out 


🔸️COLOR-STORY CRITIQUE: 


• this palette inholds the nice 'light-to-dark' gradient that I always look for. The included shades range from light to midtone to deep. There is only one option available to create depth in your look, which drastically limits the palette's versatility (i.e., the types/amount of varying looks you can create) 


• realized that there was a lot of redundancy amongst the shimmers. The nuances between such minor shade subtleties are hardly noticeable in an overall look 


• there are a few neutral 'transition shades' included in this particular color-story. I am unsure how they will fare on a range on skintones


• the formula balance ratio in this palette is 8:12 (mattes to non-mattes), &amp; I think a 40% / 60% formula split shows that it's leaning heavily 'shimmer-y'. I prefer either completely balanced layouts, OR matte-heavy


• I consider this to be a 'warm-toned' color-story, and it's not unique to my collection in the slightest. I do particularly like the entire layout of this palette 


• there is NOT a matte black in this palette, which I always prefer - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'


• there were no 'dud' shades in this palette


• there is not any decorative embossing on any of the included shadows 

...... 

🔸️FORMULA EVALUATION: 

// 

🔹️ | MATTES |: 

+ the mattes are SUPER powdery in all aspects (I prefer a powdery formula)
+ some of the mattes have tiny pinpoint glitter specks in them, but they perform just as a normal matte shadow
+ I found this formula easy to blend
+ each color applied to my eyes the same as it appears as in the pan
+ this is a more 'buildable' formula (in lieu of being 'directly pigmented'), making it easier to manage and control the formula 

// 

🔹️ | SHIMMERS |: 

+ EXTREMELY cream-like in texture 
+ different levels of shimmers - some provide a slight shimmer, while others are intensely foiled 
+ there is both a mix of sheer &amp; pigmented bases - each shade is different 
+ attempted all application methods - my finger, a dry brush, &amp; a dampened brush. It worked exactly the same using all methods. 

...... 

🔸️PACKAGING: 


+ I am partial to the cosmetic look of mirrored chromatic packaging - ESPECIALLY that of the rose gold variety. This palette looks luxurious and expensive, and it feels that way in the hands 

+ I think this packaging is an excellent representation of the brand (Iconic London), as it is completely in-line with other products offered in their range and collection. 

...... 

🔸️COMMENTARY: guys, I'm having a REALLY hard time right now - I'm on 'Day 4' of my sugar detox, and I'm going through withdrawal from a very addictive medication all at the same time. I'm getting INTENSE headaches, feel immensely fatigued, feel dizzy af, and basically don't feel like doing anything. If you are reading this, and YOU are one of those people that really likes giving me a hard time over my eyeshadow looks - just let it pass gently today, okay? I'm suffering bad enough, and tried my best (given the circumstances). 

...... 

▪️FINAL RECOMMENDATION: (recommend) 

+ very easy to blend
+ fun and safe shade selection
+ beautiful display palette 

...... 

+ Favorite Shade: Summer Glow
- Least Favorite Shade: Ultraviolet 

...... 

🚦 RATING: B 

...... 

⭐ RATING LEGEND: 

+ A = totally wow'd me
+ B = not the best, but I like it
+ C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product
+ D = this didn't work out for me
+ F = I totally hate this

Makeup,Where/how to start learning how to do makeup,"Hi, I'm a teenager who wants to learn how to do makeup, but I have no idea where to start or how to learn. I have a few questions, but literally any advice is welcomed.

2. Where can I get decent makeup for somewhat cheap? I don't have much money (cons of being a teen lmao), but I have some. I would go to Walmart, but I saw a video that said Walmart was really bad for makeup
3. Where do I even start with makeup? I have basically no makeup, but there's just so many different things used for makeup Idek where to start
4. This isn't a question, but if anyone could tell me everything that I need to get started (idk, brushes or stuff?)
Any and all advice is appreciated. Thank you!",2022-06-26 12:30:33

Makeup,How do I prevent my base makeup from making my sebum more apparent?,"I was hoping to get some help with how I should be approaching base makeup application (or anything else that may be the root of this issue). I noticed that I'm never able to get a nice, uniform layer of foundation in the areas between my eyebrows, the sides of my nose, and my temples. Little sebum dots will always show through and they look worse than when I wasn't wearing any foundation at all.

I think I have combination skin since I form dry patches around my nose but the rest of my face gets pretty oily throughout the day. Lately, I have been using the elf poreless putty primer and the NARS radiant longwear foundation for my base; my skin prep before that is washing my face with the inkey list oat cleansing balm, lancome tonique confort hydrating facial toner, and then using the innisfree jelly cream. I have been using the ordinary's AHA + BHA peeling solution once a week for about 3 weeks now. I like to blend the foundation in using a beauty blender, and I did notice that the NARS foundation blends in slightly better—on occasion—when I use my hands, but I do get some streakiness from this application method too.",2022-06-26 13:46:09

Makeup,I look ill without makeup even when well. What can I do?,"I know it's a common problem to look ill w/o makeup if you wear it very regularly, but I wear a full face of makeup once a week at most. Any other day I would wear maybe a lip product or eyeshadow, or nothing at all. Sometimes I just wear a full face because I'm bored or get tired of how ill I look and I want to jazz myself up. Some days I look fresh and glowy, but other ones (like today) my skin looks kind of grey, sallow and blotchy, and my lips are pale, for no apparent reason. I feel fine - I eat well, sleep enough, drink plenty of water and exercise. I also use retinoids on prescription as an acne treatment which have been exfoliating my skin. I'm not sure what could be going on. Might it be hormonal? 

Other than finding potential causes, is there a way to brighten up my face without using makeup, perhaps by a skincare technique or something else? Any advice is much appreciated.",2022-06-26 21:17:38

I first ordered it in 2020 and love it, and recently ran out. I thought it was super cool that they sell a refill for the applicator, so I purchased that. The only problem is that I cannot for the life of me figure out how to actually refill it???

Has the cartridge changed in the last two years, making a new refill not compatible for the old applicator? Or am I just missing something?

Makeup,How to prime and set cream-to-powder foundation,"I have oily, acne-prone skin and have had decent luck with cream foundations for full coverage in the past, so I'm probably going to buy a cream-to-powder foundation ([Milani Conceal + Perfect](https://www.ulta.com/p/conceal-perfect-smooth-finish-cream-powder-foundation-pimprod2012993) is the only one that I can find that isn't absurdly expensive). However, I don't know what kind of primer I should use under such a foundation and I especially don't know what I should use to set it. I'm concerned that powder on top of powder might dry out my skin and make it more oily (which has happened in the past), but also that setting spray might not ""set"" anything at all. Do any of you use cream-to-powder foundation and what do you use to set it?

Also, bonus question: can I use a beauty blender to apply the foundation? I had pretty good results with beauty blenders before, although that was with a CC cream/tinted moisturizer and not an actual foundation.",2022-06-27 01:34:22

Makeup,(PLEASE HELP) Foundation recommendations for combination skin while using acne topicals,"**Backstory (feel free to skip to the bottom to get a quick summary):**

I have an extreme case of combination skin. My skin is acne-prone, very sensitive, dry (eczema), and oily (genetically). I've had a few dermatologists over the past decade, for my acne and eczema, and love the one I've been seeing for the past couple years. I've always used topical acne treatments at night but with the help of my current dermatologist I've also been using a daytime topical for acne.

Although I love the progress my skin has made while using a daytime topical, it has made my makeup look disgusting. **Literally disgusting**. Foundations refuse to stick to certain parts of my face, the makeup pills up on my jawline/hairline, my face looks cakey/patchy/dry. I only wear makeup once in a blue moon to feel more confident, but end up feeling insecure. 

**Does anyone know of any foundations that work well with acne topicals?** *Also here are the other skincare products I use before applying foundation: CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion, MDSolarSciences Mineral Cream SPF 50, Milk Hydro grip primer.*",2022-06-27 02:51:51
Makeup,"Pale, blue eyes and light brown hair - struggling to find flattering lip products","I'm pale with blue eyes and light brown hair. I find it difficult to wear much colour on my lips as it doesn't seem to suit me, but after getting bored of wearing Dior Lip Glow everyday I thought I'd try buy a few lip products to experiment. 

I first bought the Mac Faux lipstick as it's cool toned and I'd seen it look really pretty on others with my kind of colouring, but on me it looks way too pale and pink. I then bought the Maybelline Lifter Gloss in the shade Petal and I like that colour if I sheer it out a little bit, but it has quite thick gold glitter in which I don't like. I was surprised I liked it as it's a little more red and darker then I thought I would like. I then bought the Nars Afterglow lip balm in Dolce Vita which I really like, again it's more of a red/rosy kind of colour but it seems to balance out my features and looks like my lips but better. I really like the way the Dolce Vita looks but I'm looking for someone with a little more pigment, ideally not matte.

Can anyone recommend me some other products to try are similar to Nars Dolce Vita Afterglow lip balm.",2022-06-27 02:51:54
Makeup,How to conceal dark spot on lips,"Hi guys. I have spot on the edge of my lip that causes that spot to be a noticeably darker shade of pink than the rest of my lips.

Makeup,Should I be wearing foundation to protect my skin?,"Before the pandemic I was wearing foundation basically every day (usually Too Faced's Born This Way). But once I stopped needing to go out I thought I'd give my skin a break. At first my skin hated it! I was breaking out more than ever and couldn't tie it to doing anything different other than not wearing foundation. But after a transition period I felt like my skin was consistently clearer than ever. When I started to occasionally go out again and put on foundation, after removing it I felt like my skin looked even more dull and gray than before putting the make up on, even though I carefully removed all of it. 

I now wear a tinted sunscreen in place of foundation. I thought not wearing foundation would just be better for my skin. But I've have read online that wearing a layer of make-up/foundation can help protect against damage from free radicals, pollution, sun, etc. Are these claims true? 

I recently turned 30 and want to up my skincare game, so I'm debating whether incorporating foundation back into my routine would be better for my skin if I'm wearing one with clean ingredients and removing it properly. On the other hand it's been nice not to deal with since I hate the feeling of foundation and the look of anything other than very light coverage. I've also considered BB or CC creams instead but I have tried so many brands and they all break me out or sit weirdly on my skin. Any advice on this?",2022-06-27 04:05:58

Makeup,Advice for Mature Skin + Hyperpigmentation,"When working on mature, aging skin with sun damage, hyperpigmentation, dark spots etc. it always helps to substitute full coverage products for color correcting. Always prep skin well, and apply a color complementary to the shade of the blemish you want to neutralize, before foundation. It's helpful if your corrector has built-in coverage, like the graftobian glamour creme corrector palettes. (they come in a fair, and deep color way). If you still require more coverage after correction, try using a full coverage creme pigment like the kevyn aucoin sensual skin enhancer, only over the areas you've corrected. I did bridal makeup on a mature client recently and utilized these techniques, then applied a medium coverage, natural dewy finish foundation on top (dior forever skin glow). This ensured that her skin was perfected but that the glam looked flattering in most lighting. you can also build coverage when setting the face, by setting with a foundation powder i.e. mac studio fix powder, onesize turn up the base powder, urban decay stay naked the fix, etc.",2022-06-27 04:40:55

Makeup,My eyebrows are always too dark!,"I'm 24 years old, I have a medium brown complexion (Mexican heritage), and very dark brown hair. When I was a preteen, I over plucked my  brows because I wanted them to look like Jenna Fischer's (Pam) in season 1 of The Office. It has been tragic ever since. My brows have never fully grown back. The tails of my brows are almost non existent, and they are thinner than they should be because I severely over plucked them on the bottom. 

This being said, I have to fill them in every day in order to look normal. But because of how sparse they are, I'm always way too heavy handed. My brows hairs naturally grown downard, and it's literally not possible for me to make them ""stand up"" (like feather brows). I've tried pencils, pomades, and powders, and yet my brows always come out too dark because of how much product I need to use in order to get a clean shape. 

Looking at childhood photos of myself,  my natural brows appear grey-colored compared to my black hair. And that seemed to suit my face a lot more. I'm wondering if there's a brown product out there that can help me achieve that same affect, i.e. light in color but pigmented enough for me to get a clean shape on my sparse brows.

I always throw away my mascara after using it for 5 months..I don't know how the expired bottle of mascara never ended up in trash. So on Saturday, I was running late for a class and in a hurry I applied the expired one. Didn't stop to think why the texture was flaky. It was 5 hrs later that I realized it and when I checked it turns out I applied the expired mascara. I washed my face asap. I don't feel anything out of ordianry as of now. But I'm afraid I've somehow made a grave mistake and I'm really worried what will happen. I've read that expired mascara can cause blind eyes. Is this true? Could anyone please suggest what should I do? Should I go to a doctor for checkup or do something else? Please help!

Makeup,Centre of attention makeup.,"Okay, so Instagram algorithm found a someone for me to follow maybe 2yrs ago now, pretty cool content, pretty cool gal.
Her names Courtney hollins, aka Centre of attention make up artisty.
Let me begin by saying i liked her, I liked how she'd say things, being from New Zealand it's cool to see a auzzy getting up there, she had good product reviews, all around she's a little rough around the edges but that's just the kiwi auzzy personalitys.
The other night Courtney makes a post, with a screen cap of someone's Facebook for all of her followers to see (low-key really wishing is screenshoted her post myself kinda hoping maybe one off you have 😅) she's calling this lady out for commenting shitty stuff on her posts and just being a generalized menace.
So i commented, jist of my comment was the post was shitty and you don't know what crazies follow you, pretty much immediately the post gets taken down, which was the optimal outcome imo.
But that's not quite what happened, the post got reported until it got taken down, and then Courtney did a live stream, explaining why she blocked everyone who didn't agree with her posting someone's Facebook account for all off her followers to see. So to her, just because she's got a following why does that mean she's not aloud to stick up for herself? (Which i agree with, stand up for yourself, don't post screencaps knowing full well your minions are about to go harass ol aunty dolmio yaknow.) 
The entire problem, is not the the fact she stood up for herself, it's that she thinks she's done nothing wrong in this situation.
So im asking myself why im writing this, and the entire reason is keep an eye on this girl, she's going to be the next Jeffree Star.

The one thing is I like my eyelashes curled, and I find that no matter what I do they don’t tend to hold an exaggerated curl without mascara (many mascaras still don’t hold that long but I found one that does a fantastic job). 

I have pretty curly hair and my eyelashes do have a slight curl to them naturally, like, my lashes aren’t dead straight.

I've tried moving away from mascara unless I was full glam so I’ve tried two clear mascaras (Maybelline and Essence) and the formula is just too wet and takes too long to dry, by the time it does the formula has already flopped the curl. I’ve also tried warming up my eyelash curler but again it doesn’t hold that long.

Makeup,Looking for a specific lipstick by L’Oreal from many years ago,"My mum is looking for this lipstick she was gifted many years ago that consisted of two tubes joined together next to each other. One tube had a coloured lipstick and the other had a hydrating and clear sort of lip balm. If I remember correctly, the coloured side also had a coloured tube while the clear side was a silver tube. It’s possible it was travel size so maybe the packaging looked different on the full size one.

She loved the lipstick because it wouldn’t smudge. It was sort of like a liquid lipstick but the look and consistency of it was more like a regular lipstick. She doesn’t have the old packaging anymore so I’m having trouble trying to find it. All I know is that it was by L’Oreal. 

My mum would like to purchase it because she has a wedding to attend and it used to be her fave lipstick, but I don’t even know if they still make it.

I prefer more natural products so i have been using bare minerals complexion rescue tinted moisturizer but have heard good things about the brand ILIA

Makeup,Are there any magnetic eyeliner pencils?,"So I have super sensitive skin and I'm also neurodivergent and eyelash glue makes my eyes hurt (my eyes are super sensitive like if I don't use eyedrops 15 times a day Idk what I'd do) and liquid liner also makes my eyes hurt. 

Both liquid liner and eyelash glue have 1 thing in common: they go on wet and then dry. The drying is what kills me. My eyes are already way too dry they don't need to be dryer. 

I use crayon or pencil eyeliners instead (urban decays is my fav its so soft!!) But I've used brands like Tarte, Urban Decay, etc.

My thing is bc of my medical conditions sometimes my eyelashes are uneven (like super noticeable uneven) and I would like to put on small falsies when that happens....issue is the eyelash glue or liquid magnetic liners.

So does anyone know of magnetic eyeliner that is a cream kind of base like the tarte or urban decay eyeliners? 

Also yes I've tried the magnetic ones that stick to themselves (upper and under lashes) and they don't stay on well bc I wear glasses and one wrong blink w my glasses on too close and they can fall off 😭",2022-07-01 01:38:03

Makeup,Good eyelash curler that can properly curl lashes?,"A few months ago I lost my beloved eyelash curler. It was one of the best ones I’ve used and I had it for a long time. I’m pretty upset I lost it. I believe it was a Revlon curler. Ever since then, every other eyelash curler - even the new Revlon ones I’ve bought - haven’t created that same effect of curling my lashes the way I liked before, despite it being the exact same curler. With the new curler, I press down and clamp like I usually do, but it hardly curls them and they’re still sticking mostly down. Or if is curled, it’s awkwardly curled and clumped together.

I’m wondering if this is due to the eyelash curler pads being brand new and not “worn down”. When they’re new, they don’t curl my lashes properly. Whereas if it’s been used and “indented” over time, it makes my lashes way better. I read a suggestion that said to keep using the new one to wear it down, but I don’t like it in the meantime, plus I tried waiting and I haven’t seen much improvement. This frustrates me as I have decently long eyelashes that would curl up perfectly with my old curler, and I make sure to clamp and hold and look down for awhile while curling them, and it does nothing. Should I try a new curler? Any recommendations?",2022-07-01 02:00:06

Makeup,Makeup noobie…I need to master makeup before my first job!,"
Hi everyone! 

The only experience I’ve had with makeup is primer -&gt; foundation -&gt; eyeliner -&gt; mascara -&gt; blush then lipstick (occasionally I’ll spray a setting mist) 

I’ve looked at some tutorials for work make up but everyone’s listing so many different products that I’m honestly lost! 

What are the essential products that a beginner needs and who’s the best channel on yt to follow as a beginner? 

(For now, I have all of the stuff listed above plus eye palettes, blush, highlighter and bronzer palette, and an eyebrow pencil (which is unusable); my eyeliners are the pen type and the gel+brush type)) 

Thanks!",2022-05-26 16:34:06
Makeup,WARNING!!! CULTBEAUTY IS A SCAM!!!!,"It's an amazingly ridiculous shopping experience with u/cultbeauty .

[https://www.cultbeauty.com/](https://www.cultbeauty.com/) 

I ordered a package worth more than 300$ from Cultbeauty and ship to Singapore. 

The package arrived in Singapore on the 10th of May; then, the DPD website kept showing: ""Your parcel is being processed through customs, pending the payment of duties and taxes. "" Then I wrote to the CB team asking for advice because generally in Singapore, the local delivery company will deal with the payment then collect from us.  

Well, I didn't expect to open a communication black hole that would suck all my questions and lead the conversation to become an intellectual battle with the AI from the Cultbeauty team. They hold onto one notion - You have to help yourself—no support from Cultbeauty or their delivery company. You need to call local customs and find the right local service providers from thousands of local delivering companies. (If you are interested, you can DM me for the conversation feed. Warning, it will cost high-level irritation.)

The funny thing is, I did find a way to hop on a call with the officer from the Singapore Customs. He warned me that this company might be a scam. 

So, to whoever wants to buy from them, remember my experience. Cultbeauty will take your money and politely tell you to fuck off.",2022-05-26 16:39:28

I am also running low on my sunscreen so I figured I would look into a primer and sunscreen that would compliment the NARS foundation.

1. I haven't been able to find if the NARS foundation is water-based or oil-based, but I assume a hydrating/gripping primer would probably be the best? I've tried a sample of the Smashbox  
Photo Finish Primerizer+ Hydrating Face Primer and liked it, but i've also heard good things about the Milk Hydrogrip Primer. Any recommendations?

Makeup,How to make my skin not-shiny?,"Hi, all!

So, I have really big pores and, as a result, I tend to avoid foundation. I spent years struggling with foundation and I used all sorts of pore-minimizing products and primers, but I could never get it to look right. So in the end, I just gave up. Luckily, my skincare is good enough that I can go without foundation and still look okay.

The trouble is that my skincare products make me look really shiny. I dislike it a lot. I feel like I appear greasy. I'd like to make my skin more matte. I've tried translucent finishing powders, but these powders settle into my pores and end up looking awful. 

What can I do to make my face less shiny? Thanks!",2022-05-27 00:59:33

I have full coverage concealer because I want to make my imperfections less noticeable (mostly acne and dark spots).  I have read that people usually apply foundation before concealer, so I bought some of that too.

Up until now, I always put on foundation before concealer because I assumed that I was supposed to.  The articles that I read say that foundation is needed to provide a base for other makeup.  However, I am starting to wonder if I really need that base because I have seen some women wear concealer without foundation, and their faces looked great.

Makeup,Quartzstone in Face Powder?,"Hi! 

I have recently been looking into face powder alternatives that do not contain talc. I wanted to get something that was preferably a pressed powder and I have finally found something I wanted to try, however the product contains “quartzstone”. I know that quartzstone and silica are related and that makeup products contain a form of silica called hydrated silica that does not allow for silicosis. Should I be concerned about this product since it lists quartzstone instead of silica/hydrated silica? The product is Flower Goddess Pressed Setting Powder by the Chinese brand Flowers Know. Here is the full ingredient list, any info is appreciated:

💄 Monthly Makeup Routine Reviews • May, '22 

...... 

➡️ NOTE: the information contained within this post is based upon my research, opinions, and experience. As always, buy/use the products that make YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun. 

...... 

🧐 PURPOSE: every month I'm shopping my stash for ONE product from each makeup category. Over the course of the month, I'm going to really get to learn about each product in-depth, and eventually relay to you, the findings. During this process, I'm also figuring out which products I'm completely decluttering from my collection. 

...... 

🔹️POTENTIAL PROCESS QUESTIONS: 

+ Total Products This Month: 16
+ Total Products I'm Keeping: 11
+ Total Products I'm Decluttering: 3
+ Total Products I'm Repurchasing: 1
+ % of Routine Fully Used/Decluttered: 25% 


• DECLUTTERED PRODUCTS: will be placed in a special box for the time being as I collect more, but I intend on gathering a few more over time, and selling (the ones I paid for) as a bundle for solely the cost of shipping on my boutique. The products that I got for free will be bundled together and I will hold a bundle giveaway for people who don't mind (sanitized) secondhand products used only by me. 


• PROS OF THIS SYSTEM: significant product knowledge, ability to get intensively creative with products, easy to manage such a small grouping of products, no hard decisions on what makeup to wear every day, means to actually use up products (or make a pretty big dent)


• CONS OF THIS SYSTEM: boredom (I got notably bored at the three-week mark), if something you pick really sucks - you have to explore ways to make it work in other capacities, sadness of potentially decluttering something you spent a lot of money on if it doesn't perform

🔔 SELECTED REVIEWS (full reviews on each product used + a complete 'try-on' are already uploaded on my YouTube channel) 


▪️PRIMER: Veil Cosmetics - Sunset Light Primer Serum • this is such an interesting and unique type of bottle; I love how satisfying it is to see exactly how much I've been using. Each time I've used this, I've found that three pumps was the perfect amount. This primer has absolutely no scent. It gives my skin the most PERFECT sunlit glow - it looks like a strong luminous primer without having any sparkly chunks or obnoxious shine. This primer has worked perfectly along with every other product I've used alongside it. It immediately absorbs into my skin and provides for a very smooth finish without that silicone-like, slippery feeling. 


🕶 SHADE: n/a 

💲 PRICE: $48.95 (veil cosmetics) 

🔹️ ACQUIREMENT: gratefully received as PR 

🔆 FINAL DECISION: keeping 

...... 

▪️EYE PRIMER: Sample Beauty - Erase &amp; Boost Base • the best thing about this is that you get a MEGA amount in the pot! Unfortunately, it smells like baby powder - but the scent doesn't translate once you actually apply it. I used to LOVE this when I first got it, but the more I've been using it - my disdain has grown. On the good side, just a little teeny bit goes such a long way, it fully color corrects any harsh discoloration, and it truly provides for a full-coverage base. Sadly, as I apply it, it starts going on 'patchy', and leaving some spots more hydrated and others very, very dry - making for the shadows on top to look very odd and uneven. ALSO - this primer severely creases on me. 


🕶 SHADE: 3 

💲 PRICE: $2.46 (beauty bay) 

🔹️ ACQUIREMENT: purchased myself 

🔆 FINAL DECISION: declutter 

...... 

▪️CONCEALER: The Crème Shop - Full Coverage Concealer • off the top, this has a HORRIBLE, barely tolerable, strong paint-like scent to it. Every time I utilized it like a 'normal' undereye concealer - it LOOKED extremely flawless, but it burned the hell out of my eyes and caused them to turn red and severely water. After narrowing it down to THIS product, I completely stopped using it as an undereye concealer, but found it looks absolutely magical when used as a foundation base product OR as a facial spot concealer. As a foundation base, I apply a few 'x's' all over my face, and it blends-out flawlessly with a brush. It gives me the perfect coverage, and it doesn't look heavy or cakey in the least! As a spot concealer, it works wonders and lasts all day long. I do enjoy setting it with a bit of powder, as it does have a bit of a tacky-feeling. 


🕶 SHADE: light 

💲 PRICE: $5.98 (amazon) 

🔹️ ACQUIREMENT: purchased myself 

🔆 FINAL DECISION: keeping 

...... 

▪️SETTING POWDER: OPV Beauty - Loose Setting Powder • overall, I just haven't had any luck with this powder whatsoever. I've tried every possible way to apply it - with a sponge, a large fluffy brush, a more precise flimsy brush, and a velour puff. No matter which way I apply it, the final result is always a heavy, cakey, messy look that creases on me, making my face look several years older. This powder collects into my most porous areas on my face, giving me a white-cast that doesn't disappear. On a good note, there's no scent to it, and the plastic dispenser partition is excellent in its construction. I love the IDEA of this powder, but its actual performance has been less-than-impressive.

▪️EYESHADOW PALETTE: Revolution Beauty - Reloaded • the more I've used this over the course of the month, the more I've been ABSOLUTELY loving it. It has served as a multipurpose product for the eyes, lips, and face. After getting creative with it, I was able to pull-off some of the shades as amazing face and lip products. The shades and textures incororated into this palette are so excellent - I cannot believe people are skipping on this! I seriously want to buy more 'Reloaded' palettes to see if the formula is consistent throughout the range. Each eye look that I've done with it, I have truly loved, and have had so much fun with. I was able to get a quick and easy look OR take it to the extreme with a dramatic, fancy look. You get a great shade selection in here, and some very interesting effects. This was my most-favorite piece that I've experienced all month long. The only 'con' I would like to make note of, is that the saturated black ink on the front of the palette has begun to rub off onto my hands, causing me angst.

▪️BROWS: Iconic London - Brow Silk • this is such an interesting product, and I truly believe it to be one of the pioneer products for many of the similar ones we see on the market today. I found it best to use this BEFORE I did any of my other makeup, as the wax would remove any foundation around the brow area. As per the instructions - I tried using it both wet and dry, and preferred its operational ability when the wax was in its dry state. I used its companion 'toothbrush-looking tool', and I also attempted to use the wax with a spoolie. Overall, the 'toothbrush-tool' was much more effective with this particular formula. I initially applied the wax by back-combing my brow and ensuring the wax fully and evenly coated the entire eyebrow. Then, I went for the feathery look, and fluffed my eyebrow up a pinch. After I was done applying the rest of my makeup, both eyebrows totally fell. This wax doesn't have ANY hold to it at all. Upon touch, my brows felt very waxy and almost wet. I wouldn't recommend this for any sort of 'laminated look' - in fact, I wouldn't recommend this at all.

i bought CmaaDU’s 10 pack (i think) of liners from amazon. i love them but once they dry, they sometimes will start to peel or i have to put on a few layers b/c they can look streaky.

Makeup,Foundation recs for hotter weather?,"Hi all,

Does anyone have any recommendations for foundation now that it's getting warmer here in the US? It could be foundation, bb cream, skin tint or whatever. I've been interested in Giorgio Armani silk foundation, Fenty eaze skin tint, and Nars light reflecting.

I have big pores and oily skin. Mild acne that comes and goes but not a major concern. I mainly look for something that just helps even out my skin color and can really last all day. 

I've been using Estee Lauder's double wear but I'm not sure why lately (now that it's warmer... I'm guessing it might be due to weather?) when I've been doing my foundation and then setting it with my usual Laura Mercier translucent powder, it gets patchy, ugly and doesn't blend well. The patchiness also happened today when I tried setting my face after using Missha's red tube BB cream. Anyone know why? I like using setting powder since I don't like that sticky feeling from wet foundation on my face. Would changing to setting spray be better? I've been looking into getting Urban Decay's all nighter after seeing many posts recommending that. How long does it take for the UD setting spray to dry down your face so it's not wet/sticky?

Do people just deal with the sticky feeling on their face? How long does your makeup take to dry down  in general?

What else could I change in my routine to stop the patchiness from happening? I take good care of my skin daily so I don't think it's a problem with skincare.

On a side note, somewhat related... Does anyone know why good coverage of SPF is not common in western beauty? In Kbeauty there's always atleast 30+SPF in all their face base products. I was just thinking maybe it would be nice to find a foundation that also has SPF already so I know it will mix well with each other.",2022-05-28 13:44:21

Makeup,Seeking Opinions: Similar product finish to E.L.F. Matte Eyeshadow (liquid),"The finish of e.l.f.'s matte eyeshadow (link to a Walmart listing below) was \~perfection\~. I have been seeking a liquid to matte finish eyeshadow, and have been very disappointed with market options. The o.g. is discontinued, active listings I highly suspected are old/expired and are more than the original MSRP.  

Things I have tried:

* E.L.F No Budge Shadow Stick - I think it doesn't apply easily and doesn't have the same finish.
* E.L.F. Shadow Lock Eyelid Primer - I find that this creases and does not work well with shadows overtop (turns colors gray and prevents quality blending)
* E.L.F. Liquid Glitter- Fine, but no matte option
* Ulta Brand  Matte Cream Eyeshadow - doesn't have the same quality finish once it dries and shadows do not blend well over top
* M.A.C. Pro Longwear Paint Pot Eyeshadow - for the price point, I still prefer the E.L.F. and not impressed with the dry down and how shadows work overtop
* Wet N Wild Megalast Liquid Catsuit Creme Eyeshadow - doesn't have the same quality finish once it dries and shadows do not blend well over top

Makeup,Foundation makes me look old!,"Hi everyone, 💕

does anyone else have the problem that foundation is making them look old? 🤯😤

I am female and just turned 40. I would say, in general, I don’t look older than I am. I never smoked, I don’t drink, I avoid the sun and I always wear SPF 50, all the year round. Also, I would say I eat quite healthy.

I don’t use makeup on a daily basis anymore (currently on parental leave); mostly I only use moisturiser and sunscreen; sometimes a slightly tinted sunscreen on top. 

For some special occasions, I still like to wear some makeup. But lately I found that it makes me look soooo old - much older than I look without it imho. 

The problem is that my skin is very sensitive and lacks moisture, but at the same time it tends to get a bit oily, so I need to use powder to set the foundation, and I feel this is what is making me look old: the foundation &amp; powder collect in my wrinkles and make them appear more prominent than they seem without makeup. 

What can I do? I am just using the wrong products? 

As I said already, my skin is very sensitive. I have rosacea and can’t tolerate scented skincare products, and products that contain a lot of alcohol, since they will irritate my skin. I feel, this makes everything quite complicated, because most foundations contain perfume and/or alcohol. 

But maybe someone is in the same boat as me and has the ultimate recommendation which products might actually work?

I finally got a day shift position this year. I have felt the need to start wearing makeup again. I’ve been pretty excited about eyeshadow and lipstick even though I mostly feel I have no idea what I’m doing. I try watching eyeshadow tutorials but I’m mostly just very confused. 

Anyway, what I’ve noticed is that I find foundation and face powder extremely uncomfortable now when years ago I hated my skin so much that face powder was my favorite. I am wondering if it’s seen as inappropriate to wear just eye makeup (shadow and mascara or sometimes just mascara) and lipstick/lipgloss? Do people notice? I always wear some kind of serum/lotion/moisturizer so my skin isn’t completely naked. Maybe this is a stupid question but is it okay to go without foundation and powder when you’re using other kinds of makeup?",2022-05-30 04:02:01

Makeup,What are the best under eye setting powders?,"I’ve noticed in the past 2 years that my under eyes crease a lot. I’m almost 27, dry skin, with fine lines under eyes. 

I have found that my under eyes look better without concealer as I don’t really need the coverage, dark circles aren’t a concern for me and I’ve tried probably 30 concealers over the years and most just made my skin look old.

So I’ll typically just lightly go over the under eye area with whatever foundation I’m using (I use foundations geared towards normal-dry skin) but I do have to set it with a powder because I will get insane creasing throughout the day. 

What are your favorite setting powders for the under eye area? And, if there’s a light weight concealer you absolutely love, and doesn’t crease much/if at all, what is it?

Thank you!",2022-05-30 09:15:17

Makeup,Foundation oxidizing,"Hi guys, I’m about to give up on my makeup journey here. 

I have oily skin type. A bit of acne and redness but they are not too much of a concern. My concern is no matter how perfect of a shade my foundation or tinted moisturizers are, they oxidize on me.

I have medium/tan warm skintone and after a few minutes of applying product on my face it turns darker and Orange around my chin. 

I have tried several primer and foundation /tint/concealer combos and I always look like I applied a self tanner on my face. 

I’m in my late 20’s and I have not committed to makeup in years. When I was in my early twenties I never had to worry about my foundation changing colors, so I find this problem absurd. I work in a customer service based job so I want to keep up my appearance more, but I am so close to giving up.

I bought a foundation mixing pigment that will lighten my foundation, so that once it oxidizes I was hoping it will be close to my skin color, but the problem is how orange my skin (especially my chin)  gets.

I’m also debating on buying foundations or tints that are 2 shades lighter, so that when it oxidize it will be closer to my skin color??? 

Even if I don’t get advice I wanted to see if anybody experienced the same as me? Def feel like I’m alone here",2022-05-30 13:27:10

But I have an oily t-zone and within 15 minutes, my t-zone would make my base makeup cakey if I don’t use mattifying primer, setting sprays, matte base makeup, and translucent powder to make it matte. I have to use oil absorbing wipes and powder every 3ish hours to stop the oil from coming through, and in the end, my makeup always looks cakey, dry, and overpowered. How do I combine dewy, glass skin base makeup but ensure that my t-zone stays matte? Any South Korean bb cream or cc cream recommendations would be appreciated too.

Makeup,Question: HOW TO USE A MAKEUP PALETTE?," Cracking the color code, on the other hand, does not necessitate a degree in Art History or even makeup artist credentials. All you need are the appropriate eyeshadow brushes and the right color combination knowledge

Most eyeshadow palettes are divided into three color categories: light, medium, and dark shades.

* The light shades should be applied to your brow bone and the inner corner of your eyes in the same way that our favorite highlighters are applied to the tops of your features. 
* Medium shades are the key players in your eyeshadow palette. They can be used to build and create any makeup look, depending on how dramatic you want to be.
* For the perfect cut crease that gives the illusion of giant eyes, outline a V in the crease of your eye with the darkest colors

**How to Apply Eyeshadow Palettes to Get a Natural Look?**

1. Apply an eyeshadow primer
2. Create your foundation
3. Sketch a crease
4. Blend and highlight

Makeup,What can I do with my face shape?,"My face shape is quite hard to describe… I guess you could say it’s long and squarish, with high cheekbones and hanging down from them at the sides (but I am young, 22F, so I wouldn’t call them jowls). I have what they call a “resting b*tch face” because it’s so long and downward sloping. I don’t have the nice round/heart shaped face a lot of people seem to, so I know traditional contouring would just make my cheekbones look more harsh and extreme.

Makeup,Honest Review of Jones Road What The Foundation (WTF),"I’m easily swayed by good and persistent advertising and Jones Road has it. It’s been all over social media so and I love trying new products so here’s my review: 

- There isn’t a wide shade range, likely because it’s not a full coverage foundation 
- The texture is very sticky and whipped. It’s almost looks like yogurt 
- It must be blended out with your fingers or a brush. My sponge would literally NOT work because it’s so sticky.
- It’s described as a moisture balm with ‘buildable light-medium coverage’. Honestly after applying I saw…nothing. No coverage at all. When trying to build and apply more it simply would not blend into my skin due to the odd texture. My tinted sunscreen has better coverage than this foundation. 
- It’s $44 which is on the higher end, especially for a balm not a foundation. 

Conclusions: DONT buy it. I tried with an open mind and it’s not a good product in my opinion. 

Would love to hear others opinions or tips if I’m not using it correctly!",2022-05-30 23:43:49

Makeup,Oily skincare tips in summer for your glowing skin -," Summers come with brighter, longer days and unwelcome sweaty feelings. Along with temperature, the moisture situation also peaks. These certain environmental changes are indeed more problematic if you have unctuous skin. Not sure about your skin type, also find out then. Summers may spark your sebaceous glands to produce further oil painting on your skin, giving you an unwanted candescent look and flights. Yes, the overproduction of sebum mingled with sweat can lead to unattractive acne flights and fully squinch your makeup. So, gear up to prepare your skin for summer 2021.

Unctuous skin and summers are not a veritably good combination, you have to be more careful about your skin. Revising your skincare routine and streamlining your beauty closet with the stylish summer skincare products for unctuous skin that actually watch for your unctuous skin should be your ultimate beauty thing this summer!

I'm in search of a mascara that I can wear pain-free.

\- My problem is eyes + mascara = ITCH, my eyes itch 5 minutes after putting on any mascara and I have to go wash it all off ASAP. Redness, allergies, or watery eyes are not a concern for me.  
\- Preference: Would like a really obvious mascara look, not those natural looking ones. Waterproof or regular, as long as it doesn't smudge ridiculously.

Makeup,Dark red tinted lip balm?,"Hey y'all,

I haven't worn makeup except for special occasions since the pandemic hit, but when I was in high school/early college I used to do my makeup for class (or at least try to). I was always pretty bad at it, though, and always either looked overly ""made up"" or like I didn't try at all with no in between. I'm a brown-skinned black woman, so pink and coral shades don't look good on me- it seems like the only lip colors I can wear are deep red or dark plum, which are obviously really ""made up"" looking. The only way I could get around this was by using a tinted lip balm so that the pigment was *there* but not overpowering.

Now the masks are coming off and I'm going back to school in the fall, so I want to start wearing makeup again. I found [this face palette](https://www.revolutionbeauty.us/tammi-golden-hour-deep-dark-face-palette/12657092.html) from Revolution Beauty and am looking for a tinted lip balm or gloss that's in the same dark reddish-brown shade as the blush.

Makeup,BB cream making my face orange,"I’m an early 30’s female and I’ve recently started wearing makeup on a daily basis and I’m noticing my BB cream is making my face look more orange than I would like. I like that the Bb cream seems to even my skin tone and give a good base, but it also makes it quite a bit more orange or “tan” than the rest of my skin and I end up with a sharp contrast line on my chin. I switched from Covergirl Bb cream to L’Oréal Bb cream and I’m using the lightest shade available but it still seems to be a pretty intense contrast. I’m very pale so I’ve had trouble in the past finding light enough foundation that I didn’t end up being too dark compared to the rest of my skin. So basically my question is, Why does this happen with the Bb cream and how can I fix it? Are all Bb creams this way? Do I just need a lighter shade? Any brand suggestions? Any advice is appreciated!!",2022-06-01 01:44:14

Makeup,Bronzing technique is not meant for certain skin types,"I recently booked an appointment with a MUA in my local area so that I could see how a professional applies makeup on me. I was getting quite bored with my everyday makeup and wanted to see if it could be elevated. After applying my base makeup she went straight to blush/highlight but I was slightly confused because I'm used to applying bronzer and a bit of contour to add depth to my face. 

I asked her if she would be bronzing/contouring and she said no because certain techniques just don't work on certain skin tones. She said because my skin is dark (NC50/similar to Nia Long) there really isn't a need to bronze or contour because it doesn't really do anything for my skin.

 I've always found that Mocha Mami by Fenty adds colour and depth to my face so I was a bit surprised that she doesn't believe in adding contour or bronzer to deeper skin. Is this a normal practice for MUA's when working on deeper skin? Does bronzing/contouring not really do anything for deeper skin? This is my first time working with a MUA. I definitely learned a lot but this was my first time learning that bronzing/contouring isn't the best technique for deeper skin. Is there a better way to add depth to the face?

Makeup,Where does the veins theory coming from?,"I watched a YouTube video where a color analyst discussed the most common myths relating to color analysis &amp; one of the things she touched upon was the veins on our wrists are not a sole indicator in determining the undertone of the skin. She went on to explain that although she has blue veins, her overall undertone is warm.

Back then, I was a believer in the veins theory &amp; thought that blue veins=cool, green=warm but as I learn more, I know that not everyone is a cookie cutter. Sure, there are some people that had undertones matched to their veins but like I said earlier, not everyone matches with this &amp; that. Me for example, I have blue veins but there’s no indicator of coolness in my undertone.

What are your thoughts? Are veins a sole indicator or not? Does your undertone not exactly matched to your veins?",2022-04-26 05:30:10

Makeup,Guy here! I suffer from an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss on my entire body. Help me cover up my thinning brows and lashes!,"Hey guys, 

So I’ve always been known for my thick eyebrows and long lashes, but unfortunately after several years of an untreated autoimmune disease, my facial hair has reduced drastically. 

I’m looking for something that can help hide my thin areas and make my brows and lashes appear more fuller like they used to be. However, I don’t want it to look obvious that I wear makeup. Not that I’m ashamed of wearing it, (I’ve used concealer on my acne for years) I just want to maintain a more masculine appearance.

Thanks in advance!",2022-04-26 08:54:32
Makeup,Makeup wearing off through the day…. HELP PLEASE 😩,"
Hey everyone! So I am having some issues with my makeup recently:
- makeup coverage is wearing off half way through the day sometimes only a few hours after. 
- makeup looks cakey and powdered. And it feels dry on my face and heavy.
- makeup seems to slide and transfer onto everything.. 
- creasing in smile line, forehead lines

I’ve always been scared to try new products because if I don’t like it I hate returning things but I’m to a point wear I hate how I look with makeup anymore.. so I’m willing to try new things.. it looks good in photos but in person it’s awful. 

Here’s what I use:

• Skin care/prep: CeraVe Hydrating facial cleanser for normal to dry skin. CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion for normal to dry skin. And CeraVe eye repair cream.

• Primer: I currently use is ELF mineral infused face primer. I’ve tried ELF putty primer, Milani rose primer, Milani skin quench primer and I’ve tried a few other elf primers. 

• Foundation: i currently use Covergirl outlast extreme wear 24hr it’s the one I like the most so far but still have all the problems I’ve mentioned above. I’ve also used Maybelline fit me, L’Oréal infallible, Maybelline Super stay 30hr and recently I bought a foundation from the brand “The Ordinary”… I’ve even tried Urban decay all nighter before and hated it… I use a damp real technique sponge to apply. I use usually just a pump sometimes a pump and a half if I have a lot of breakouts and discoloration. 

• Concealer: I go back and forth between Maybelline fit me and Maybelline instant age rewind. Both wear off or crease and I can see my dark circles. After I use it I take a sponge and pat some loose setting elf HD powder to set it. And then take a fluffy brush and take the excess powder and put all over my face. 

• Contour: powder benefit hoola bronzer 

• Blush: Milani rose powder

• Highlight: Elf powder highlight

I do not use any setting spray because I’ve never had luck with them. I breakout. I do eye makeup and brows but I’m not having as much of an issue it’s mostly the face.. I use full coverage foundations because I have alot of discoloration and I get breakouts still at 24… at least they aren’t nearly as bad as they were in high school. But any tips or tricks or any new products please let me know below… I’m losing my mind… makeup use to be a passion of mine and I even wanted to become a mua but now it’s just frustrating me. 🙁",2022-04-26 09:00:01

Makeup,Eyeshadow Palette for Newbie,"Hello, I’m a makeup beginner and I’m looking to own my very first eyeshadow palette! I have a warm undertone, tan-medium skin. I like soft/spring/no make-up make-up looks. 

My choices are:
Zoeva Together We Shine Eyeshadow Palette,
Natasha Denona Mini Nude Eyeshadow Palette,
Anastasia Beverly Hills Modern Renaissance Eyeshadow Palette,
Too Faced Born This Way

I also thought if I should include Urban Decay Naked Heat/Naked 3 in my choices. But, they’re sold out in my area.

I was thinking if anyone can help with the decision? I really like the color theory of both the Zoeva and ND. Zoeva is on the pink side according to reviews while ND seemed to be a true neutral. So, I was thinking if I should purchase both? According to reviews Too Faced seems to be on the neutral brown side as well but it seems to have the complete color set that I would like to have. As for the Anastasia bec. it’s a cult classic but I found the color theory too pop-py? Should I wait for Urban Decay to be available? Is it worth it considering the price? 

Hoping for your guidance. Thank you very much.",2022-04-26 13:16:23

I'm not opposed to tipping, just want to know what people normally do in these cases. And if I should tip, would it be the standard 25%?

Red lips seem to accentuate the redness in my face (a mixture of scarring/ongoing spots) and I just don't know what to do! 

I have tried to find one to suit my skin tone (I'm fairly pale) but I'm not confident I've got to grips with what my undertones are etc! I *think* I suit darker reds better, as I have really dark brown hair and green eyes. I think I prefer these colours over the bright bright reds you can get, which I think look a little cheap (on me personally!) Some reds I currently own are  KVD naz fur ahtoo and Vampira.

Makeup,"Contour looks patchy, please help!!","I'd say I have some experience with makeup, but no matter what I do I can't get my contour to look right, whether I use a cream or powder product. The colour comes out extremely uneven, like it's balling up on parts of my skin and simply not going on other parts, and it looks like really exaggerated post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, or dirt on my face. I know not to use a bronzer as contour and to stay away from orangey shades (which make me look even worse, since I'm neutral light olive toned), so it's not the shade. I've used 3CE's contour powder in the cooler shade, and Fenty Beauty's cream contour stick in Amber; the shade match for both of these are fine (not too dark or light), it's just that I can't get the pigmentation to look even. I've tried applying with a brush, fingers, sponge.... nothing helps. The patchiness gets worse as I blend the product out. Powdering my skin before contouring has no effect. I don't usually use primer (since I hate the feeling of too many products on my skin) and I don't think this is a dry skin issue, as I  have moderately oily skin, and I regularly exfoliate and moisturise twice a day. My skin isn't perfect and there is a little bit of texture here and there on the sides of my cheeks, but it's not that pronounced, so I don't think it's my skin's texture interfering with the product either, as people with more textured skin than me can seem to make contouring products work for them. The driest areas of my face are around the eyes and on my chin, and I occasionally get flaking on my chin and nose, but my cheeks generally don't have this problem. Despite that, I have a lot of trouble getting contour and cream blushes to stick. I do have post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from previous spots; contouring products seem to emphasise them, if that makes sense? 

Please help!! I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I can't find anything online that addresses my issue, and similar threads generally conclude that the issue is dry skin, which doesn't seem to be the case for me.

If it helps, the foundation I use is Chanel Les Beiges Healthy Glow Foundation, though sometimes I use Dior's cushion foundation. Also, I still have a problem with patchy contour even if I skip the foundation and only wear SPF over my usual skincare.",2022-04-26 20:37:37

I have used Estée Lauder Double Wear foundation since I was in 8th grade to cover redness and pretty intense acne… I’m now 26 with way less severe acne, but it’s still the ONLY foundation that covers my blemishes and doesn’t crack/wipe/pill off. I’m super duper oily, though Double Wear puts up a solid fight not sliding off my face at the end of a 10 hour normal day, and I still have quite the red complexion. I’m incorporating vitamin c, gentle cleaners and snail mucin into my skincare routine and I’ve noticed such a difference in my acne, but I’d like to try a lighter weight foundation that perhaps doesn’t enlarge my pores but still gives me an even skin tone and covers minor blemishes. Drugstore foundations simply don’t do it for me (L’Oréal infallible, maybelline stay matte, nope). I just bought Fenty Pro Filt’r soft matte (goes on lighter than Estee and doesn’t accentuate pores as much which is lovely), but I’m already seeing it doesn’t have the stay power like Double Wear.

Makeup,"Eyebrow Makeup Question: clean, smudge, shape","Hi ladies! 

I am about to run to Ulta to get some things for my eyebrows but first, I need some help choosing products that fit my needs.

For context, I had a bad eyebrow waxing incident that took off the inner portion of my eyebrows so that they sit further apart than normal. The hair never grew back and I have been working on creating the perfect brow with makeup ever since. 

I add length in the middle using powder &amp; pencil. I’m not a huge fan of gels or waxes but open to ideas there too. 

Here’s where i need your help: 

I do a good bit of smudging when i add length to create a gentle, faded gradient edge. I often wish I had a product to clean up the smudging under and below the brow to make it more defined. I’ve used concealer in the past but it i find it always gets cakey or looks super visible even if I try to blend it out. It almost seems too thick or the wrong color? 

Can anyone recommend a product to use, when cleaning up and shaping around the edges, that gives some umph (or highlight?) but looks a bit more natural and less cakey? Additionally, do those pink pencils work that I’ve seen people use to outline for a bit of a bright effect? 

All suggestions welcome &amp; I’ll let you know what I get :)!",2022-04-27 02:34:39

Makeup,Reunited with Laura Mercier translucent setting powder - it is so good,"back in the day I definitely trusted beauty gurus and Sephora too much, now tables have turned and i am always skeptical of them and avoid unless necessary 🤣 when I first started getting into undereye concealing I used the LM translucent because everyone did and didnt question it since thats what all the perfect gurus were using. time went by and i stopped repurchasing the LM powder , started trying new things, saw all these vids of drugstore dupes, people saying other powders are better.. i recently started paying more attention to my eyes and trying to do light brightening/highlighting only to realize that powder always makes them look worse no matter what - it would look great beforehand but powder made it go from hydrated and even to dry if not instantly then shortly after

&amp;#x200B;

i watched a bunch of youtube tutorials like a newbie thinking there must be something im doing wrong and tried a bunch of different techniques (dusting a tiny amount on w a brush, using a damp sponge, powder puff, moisturizing more than usual, ETC) and trying different powders (maybelline fit me, kosas cloud, lys, tarte glow..) nothing was impressive at all. I figured why not go back to my roots and try the LM again with a sober non influencer influenced mind and more experience with makeup and powders. damn guys, the LM translucent really is good.. i have combo skin, this stuff really doesnt make my undereyes look dry yet it controls oil pretty well and just really sits nice on the face. im so confused at how the other powders looked dry under my eyes and sometimes cakey around my nose but this one looks good under eyes but manages oil as well? i dont know if i just have finicky under eyes but it just works on me. if anyone has any suggestions id be super open to hearing them!",2022-04-27 04:15:05

Makeup,SOS…. How do I stop transferring foundation onto ✨partners✨,"Hi, i am about as fair skinned as you can be in the absence of albinism. I am tired of my foundation (nars natural radiant longwear) ending up on my deeper toned partner’s face (and it’s happened to multiple so can’t be boiled down to an individual’s specific skin type). I have tried urban decay (original) all nighter setting spray, morphe continuous setting mist, and the too faced 3 in 1. Im inclined to not immediately point the finger at my foundation itself because i dont have an issue with transfer onto clothes or other things (aside from masks but i dont think thats avoidable). 

Anyways it’s embarrassing and i don’t want to have to think about that when I’m smoochin someone.

If it helps my makeup routine after skincare is the tiktok one (LOL):
1. Skincare that ends with fenty moisturizer w/ spf that i let soak in a little bit.
2. Super light light barely there dusting of too faced translucent setting powder
3. Followed by a whole face application of setting spray (not heavy just mist the whole face with morphe continuous setting mist).
4. You wait till that dries/soaks in and then you apply primer, i was using maybelline master primer w/ spf but recently started using the “UD all nighter ultra glow face primer dewy foundation grip” (what a long name). Both are great.
5. Then top with concealer if applicable and/or foundation. 

This has always been an issue (before my tiktok routine, before product changes, etc.), so i think it could be resolved potentially by a better setting/finishing spray or something. But im open to anything. Im genuinely tired of this happening.",2022-04-28 00:28:32

Makeup,how often should i wash my makeup brushes?,"I am in my early teens and i recently received a bunch of makeup stuff from my aunt as a gift. I as a girl was always into makeup and stuff but wasn't allowed to use it until recently. (I even got a slap from my father for applying lipstick when I was 12-ish. Lol.) I started using eyeliner only a few months back and honestly I am so in love with wearing eyeliner but again I am not allowed to. (Breaking rules a few times a week isn't that bad). Anyway, I got away from the topic. So I used the eyeshadow pallate and brushes (given by my aunt) throughout the last week for my other aunt's wedding. We had a desi wedding if you wonder why it took a whole week. So used the makeup almost everyday for a week trying out different colors and styles(loved the feeling). 
So my question is how often should I clean my brushes? I cleaned them today. I know we should clean them regularly but don't know how often.

I currently use Maneater by Tarte but considering I only use mascara on the weekends, I don't use enough of the product before it dries out in like 4 months, so I'd like to find something cheaper that I won't feel as bad throwing away if I can't use it all.

The most important thing to me is that the mascara doesn't flake too much and that it's cruelty-free. Also, it can be waterproof or not. 

Thank you so much!",2022-03-27 00:58:57

......

🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️PATCHINESS: no patchiness 


🔸️BLENDABILITY: very easy to blend out 


🔸️KICK-BACK/FALL-OUT: 


+ experienced kick-back in all shades used 


+ experienced fall-out, the most being from matte shade 'Yacht Life' 


🔸️COLOR-STORY CRITIQUE: 


+ this palette inholds the nice 'light-to-dark' gradient that I always look for. The included shades range from light to midtone to deep. There are quite a few options available to create depth in your look, which drastically improves a palette's versatility (i.e., the types/amount of varying looks you can create). 


+ there are many neutral 'transition shades' included in this particular color-story. 


+ the formula balance ratio in this palette is 19:16 (mattes to non-mattes), &amp; I think a 54% / 46% formula split is fairly balanced, &amp; provides enough range-of-use. 


+ I classify this as a mix-toned (neutral and bold) palette, &amp; I don't have another palette like this in my collection. 


+ there is NOT a matte black in this palette, which I always prefer - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. 


+ throughout exploring this entire palette, I didn't encounter any 'dud' shades. 


🔸️FORMULA EVALUATION: 

//

+ | MATTES |: 

• each one is soft, and maintains the same consistency across the palette

• they are perfect for creating gradients 

• layering them is almost impossible 

• they are absolutely true-to-tone

• it was difficult to build them up to reach their maximum potential 

• this is a more 'buildable' formula (in lieu of being 'directly pigmented'), making it easier to manage and control the formula

//

+ | SHIMMERS |: 

• these shimmers are very hard-pressed

• each one has a base pigment, making them multifunctional 

• these shimmers require building for great outcome

• works perfectly well with a dry brush, works even better with a dampened brush

......

🔸️PACKAGING: 


+ The exterior cover design/art matches the interior color-story quite well, and is on-theme with the palette's name. 


+ I think this packaging is a great representation of the brand (Morphe), as it's inline with several other products in this range.

......

🔸️RECOMMENDATION: I know this eye look is kind of weird, but I really wanted to create something that would capture the entire essence of this palette. I wanted to combine the blues, pinks, and neutrals in some way. I'm not entirely crazed about Morphe palettes, but some of them are actually really intriguing. I preferred the color selection in here, and I appreciate all the similar tones, making it very easy to create gradients. There's a hell-of-a-lot of looks to be done with this palette, and when I look at it - I just get fully inspired! 

......

▪️FINAL CONCLUSION: (recommend)

+ very easy to work with

+ amount of blend-out shades

+ multiple angles of depth

......

+ Favorite Shade: Windsurf

- Least Favorite Shade: Lazy Days

......

🚦 RATING: A

......

⭐ RATING LEGEND:

A = totally wow'd me

B = not the best, but I like it

C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product

D = this didn't work out for me

F = I totally hate this

Makeup,How do I level up my makeup?,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm somewhat of a beginner to makeup and have been experimenting with new products and styles. Currently my go-to routine is to use some The Ordinary Moisturiser on my chin, neck, and undereyes, Morphe foundation on top of these areas (these are the darkest areas on my face, or the places which have blemishes). I then use a Morphe Eyeliner Colour Pencil (I think in the shade Trendsetter) to do some eyelinger on the outer end of my bottom lid, continue it outwards to do a wing, and then connect it with my top lid and fill it in. I'll then go futher inwards on my top lid to get the eyeliner just above my eye, not just at the ends of my eye. Then I go in with mascara on the top and bottom lashes. I'll then put lip balm on my lips, and some sort of liquid lip or lipstick over the top. (Sorry for the terrible description, this is the first time I've ever described what I do:/). Sometimes I'll do blush or eyeshadow as well (super basic, just something shimmery or very light coloured eyeshadow) if I have time. 

It kind of looks like this at the moment (random video found on the internet, time 3:13): [https://youtu.be/CC-Domq\_Asw?t=193](https://youtu.be/CC-Domq_Asw?t=193)

I'm trying to figure out how to get my makeup to look like this: [https://i.redd.it/scy7vxn5zpp81.jpg](https://i.redd.it/scy7vxn5zpp81.jpg)

It's super glam and sharp and sooo beautiful. How would I get it to this level? Is anyone experienced in this level of makeup able to tell me how long it would take to do this amount of makeup before going out? Should I be putting foundation over my entire face (I don't at the moment because my face is dry and it gets cracked/textured - which is why I use moisturiser under my foundation at the moment - so should I find a good primer too, and if so, any recommendations?)? Should I be using false eyelashes, and if so, wouldn't that damage my eyelashes? Would a lip plumper damage my lips? Anything else I should add to my routine?

Thank you so much for all the advice in advance!",2022-03-27 14:34:19
Makeup,"Help please: No matter what I do, my skin always looks flat matte when I’m trying to achieve a dewy/glowy look.","I work in cosmetics so I have to wear a full face every day. Since masks are now off, I have to pay a lot more attention to my complexion than I have for the last two years. I love a glowy/dewy/glass skin/just-make-me-look-like-I-bathe-in-oil-pls look, but it feels like no matter what I do, my skin looks nothing but matte. I’m 23F, dry-combo skin, I tailor my skincare around my skin goals of course, and I thoroughly hydrate my skin as well as drinking a ton of water, but my skin always looks as dry as the Sahara even though I’m wearing ALL glowy products (will list below). I was complaining about it to my coworker today and she said “wow, yeah, honestly it looks like you TRIED to be matte”. Any advice or recommendations would help me out a ton because I’m going insane. I’ll buy any product, I’m desperate lmao. I’ll list my skincare routine in the replies so I don’t clutter up the main post as much.

My current complexion products (obvi not including my AM skincare routine) are:
-Supergoop glow SPF
-MAC radiance primer mixed with a little Strobe Cream
-NARS Radiant Creamy concealer (undereyes only)
-Dior Forever Glow foundation OR MAC Studio Radiance foundation if I’m having a good skin day and want less coverage. If it matters, I apply with a Beautyblender.
-LIGHT dusting of Hourglass ambient lighting powder (I can’t skip powder under my eyes, and I lightly dust my cheeks when using powder blush/highlight. I also dust my forehead because I have bangs)
-MAC Fix+ Magic Radiance setting spray (My other coworker literally wears a matte foundation and uses this setting spray and her skin becomes so perfectly dewy that I asked what her highlighter was and she said she wasn’t wearing any, it’s just from the setting spray. I wanted to cry.)

Do I just not put concealer there and live with the redness? Is there something else I should be doing? I try not to scrub my skin unless I have to, because it *all* dries out and looks like that. Also scrubbing those areas makes them raw and they really sting.

I *hate* the feathered look and the arched look, which is why I started drawing them. I also like having really dark pronounced eyebrows, so whatever I use has to be bold.

Makeup,Help me find my fave beauty sponge?,"I once bought a cheap beauty sponge in a pinch from Target and it's finally fallen apart and I cannot find it again!! 

In either late Fall 2019 or maybe January 2020 I was on a work trip to Nashville. I realized I forgot to pack my beauty blender so went to Target and grabbed one for under $10. It was turquoise. Rounded bottom. Hourglass shape. The top had a flat side. I loved it more than my beauty blender and I used it until it fell apart.

It was similar to this turquoise one: [https://www.amazon.com/l-f-Blending-Sponge-Latex-Free-85097/dp/B079HTFZR7](https://www.amazon.com/l-f-Blending-Sponge-Latex-Free-85097/dp/B079HTFZR7) in terms of the rounded bottom, hourglass shape, and colour, but this one is missing the flat edge.  
This one has the flat top but is missing the rounded bottom: [https://www.target.com/p/e-l-f-highlighting-blending-sponge/-/A-52504348#lnk=sametab](https://www.target.com/p/e-l-f-highlighting-blending-sponge/-/A-52504348#lnk=sametab) 

I've been through every sponge Target sells online and can't find a match. So far, e.l.f. is the closest match but I'm thinking maybe it was in a shape they no longer make BUT DOES ANYONE KNOW? Anyone remember what beauty sponges target was selling 2+ years ago? That's a normal thing for someone to keep track of, right? Is this the dumbest thing I've ever tried to crowdsource?

Makeup,"Seems like you would be the experts, describe your dream makeup area?","I'll start by saying thank you for any info you guys can provide. Also I'm a truck driver who likes to build stuff on the side, so forgive any terms or total cluelessness I show here.

My SIL has been living with us for a while after a bad divorce and is really kicking ass and getting her life better than it was. She is very big into doing her make-up and hair.  She keeps mentioning she wants a good area to get ready and just generally decompress. 
I talked to my wife (who doesn't wear make-up, so is as unsure as I am). And I said I wanted to build her a nice area for it in her room. 

So far my plan is:
My space is about 5 feet long

Obviously tons of light. 

Plugs hidden some where accessible

 a wireless charger built into the top.

Something that won't stain easily and
 cleans well 

She mentioned a chair that, to me,  looks like a director's chair, but the only reason is that it has a back, so alternative chairs with backs?

And things like I plan on it being basically 2 small ""cabinets"" with a top that can be removed, so if she ever decides to move, or we all move as a family again,  we can get this huge thing out.   


ANYHOW back to my question. What things would really make an excellent space for you all? Drawers vs cabinets? Big and deep for like blow driers and stuff? Small skinny ones? How many plugs is enough? 

I'd love if you could link pictures then point out specifics of possible. Like I said, I'm just a dumb truck driver🤣

Anyhow thank you so so much

Makeup,Stubborn eyelashes won’t hold curl!,"First time ever posting! 

I have really long, straight, and light blonde eyelashes that naturally tangle ( maybe because they are soft?) For years I have struggled to find ways to keep them curled all day. I have tried everything. I obviously have an eyelash curler (the tart one). I heat it a little before use, I do the curl up the lash trick. I spend forever curling them bc they take forever to curl in a way that looks nice (they are stubborn!) 

Then I use waterproof mascara (better than sex). I usually end up having to curl them again after applying mascara bc they already start to fall, but then they start to stick to together and look spidery. Then, after all that, a few hours later they will probably start to fall, or be completely straight again! Even in cold weather, so it’s not just because of humidity. 

I guess my question is: what now? Is there anything else I can try? Any tips or products I should look into? I don’t want to rely on extensions or eyelash perm bc of the cost and the maintenance. Thanks everyone!",2022-03-29 03:05:55
Makeup,Survey about cruelty-free products and beauty community,"Hey Guys, 

I know some of you might interested in the topic of cruelty-free products. I am looking for volunteers to participate in my survey on “The Influence of Online Communities on the Purchase Behavior of Cruelty-free Products” for a school project. The survey assesses how online communities generate interest about cruelty-free products, and whether or not they influence  the purchase behavior of these products. 

I think this is a topic that might interest a lot of people since it researches the relations of media and cruelty-free products. If you are interested, please fill out the survey. The survey should take around 3-7 minutes to complete. Your participation is fully voluntary and a withdrawal from the survey is possible at any point during its completion. No compensation is offered for participation in this survey, but your participation will be invaluable to my research. If you wish to be informed about the final results of the survey please contact me via e-mail after you complete it.

If you have any questions regarding this experiment, please do not hesitate to contact me (my email address is linked in the form).

Thank you very much in advance for your participation!

I’m medium but depending on time of the year and how much sun I’ve gotten can wear warm or more neutral medium shades. Spring is an especially weird time. I’m wondering how “forgiving” these are if the shade isn’t perfectly matched. It looks like I’m somewhere between G5 or G7 but I want it for darker areas of my face (under eyes, corners of mouth) so I might go with G5 as it’s the lightest. 

Do you all feel like it’s sheer enough to be rather forgiving? Do you like it overall? Feel free to drop other recs for a concealer and/or correctors too.

Makeup,Follow Up: Tell me about your HG Foundation,"&lt;Mods if this is not allowed please delete&gt;

Wanted to post a follow up for all you wonderful people who helped me when I asked for foundation recommendations: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Makeup/comments/ti9doj/tell\_me\_all\_about\_your\_hg\_foundation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Makeup/comments/ti9doj/tell_me_all_about_your_hg_foundation/)

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to everyone who responded - it has been a wild ride that’s for sure. 

I will not buy the lede - the winner is **Giorgio Armani Silk in 5.75**. To quickly recap, I have dry skin and needed a new foundation. However, I have olive skin so it made color matching a bit harder. (I've never worn MAC so idk my color in their system but I am definitely warm and definitely olive)

I kind of treated it like a bracket, and yesterday I swatched the final 2 contenders to declare the winner. Over the course of the week or so, I visited Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Sephora, Target and Ulta.

&amp;#x200B;

I was very up front with every sales person I encountered, and gave more or less this exact spiel - *I am on a recon mission, I will not be buying today but I aim to buy ASAP, I want to sample a foundation at home on top of my sunscreen using my normal morning routine to see how it performs, and I will be purchasing the winner hopefully by the end of the week.* 

Most salespeople were terrible at color matching compared to me trying to find my own match, except 1 woman at Sephora. I don't hold that against them though, cause I see my face multiple times every single day, so it stands to reason I have a better idea of what suits me. Here's everything I tried, in alphabetical order:

&amp;#x200B;

* Armani Power Fabric 6.0 - too deep *(matched by a Nordstrom salesperson)*
* Armani Silk 6.0 - too deep *(matched by a Nordstrom salesperson)* It is incredibly annoying that these 2 Armani shades in 6.0 were so different to each other. Power Fabric was deeper and cooler even though they were both 6.0
* Chanel Les Beiges 30 - too pink, no options warm enough *(matched by a Nordstrom salesperson)*
* Chanel Sublimage 60 - too deep *(matched by a different Nordstrom salesperson, terrible experience, didn't even want to try this foundation and she told me the Chanel one I was after was ""bullshit"")*
* Dior Forever Matte 2WO - *(matched by a Nordstrom salesperson)* not bad! Decent color match but transfers very easily, so I am not in love with the formula
* ELF Camo CC Cream Light 240W - not bad but I didn’t move forward with it, forgot why
* Estee Lauder DW 2w2 - too deep, iirc
* Estee Lauder Futurist Hydra 1w2  - not bad! Runner up
* Estée Lauder Double Wear 3W1 - too deep *(matched by a Nordstrom salesperson)*
* Estée Lauder Double Wear 2W1 - better than 3W1 but too pink 
* Estée Lauder Double Wear 2W2 - too deep 
* Fenty Pro Filt’r 145 - ever so slightly too yellow, and 140 was too light. I so desperately wanted Fenty to work, but not enough to buy 2 shades and mix my own
* Fenty Pro Filt’r 290 - good tone, but too deep
* Gucci 250O - too yellow
* IT Cosmetics in Light (I think the Ulta-exclusive one but I am not 100% sure) - side note, it’s infuriating that the shade “Light” is different across all their foundation products, some are cool toned and some are warm toned. And I think they need to name their products a little better, I was confused especially since the packaging is so similar across the board . I appreciate the Estee Lauder shade nomenclature (where 2W1 = depth-tone-level), very easy to navigate.
* Kosas - 160 too light
* Kosas - 210 ever so slightly too deep. This could've been a runner up but I felt the texture was too thick for my liking
* Kosas 270 - too deep (tried this before the 210)
* Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear 280W Bisque - too pink
* Loreal Infallible 420 - too light
* Maybelline Dewy &amp; Smooth 118 - too pink
* Maybelline Super Stay Active Wear 220 - too deep
* MUFE Forever HD 2y20 - too pink
* Nars Radiant Longwear Deauville Light 4 - too light
* Nars Tinted Moisturizer Norwich Light 1.5 - too light
* NYX Can’t Stop Won’t Stop in Nude - not bad! Runner up
* Pat McGrath Labs - No good color match, like at all. So disappointing.
* The Ordinary Coverage Foundation 2.0 YG - not bad! Would’ve moved forward but I read questionable reviews and wasn’t sure the formula was right for me.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Anything that says too light or too deep - this means I couldn’t find the right warm (olive) tone in my depth. For example, the Nars Radiant Longwear was a nice warm color but too light, but if I move one color over to a closer depth, it was the wrong undertone, so then if I move one more to the next it’s now the right tone again but 1-2 shades too deep. Same (but backwards) for anything that says too deep. Similar for anything that says too pink, it means there were no warm options in the right depth.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately Armani 5.75 is the answer.

If I had to pick something other than Armani, these are the ones I would revisit:

* Estee Lauder Futurist Hydra
* IT Cosmetics in Light 
* The Ordinary Coverage Foundation, cautiously

These are the ones I was most disappointed about since the shade was so close but not close enough:

* Fenty Pro Filt’r 145
* Gucci 250O
* Kosas - 210
* Pat McGrath Labs - I think mixing 2 colors would work here but not at $68 a pop.

Makeup,Which Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer? Or other recommendations,"I know the reformulation of the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer got a lot of negative reviews. I tried some on in Ulta today, and I thought it was okay but am not sure if the oil-free or natural formulation is better. My skin is fairly dry due to tretinoin, but I also hate the dewy look on me. Some matte foundations I've tried have just made the dryness and lines (over 40 here) look worse. 

I've also seen NARS Pure Radiant Tint recommended instead. I tried it, and it looked fine at first but was super shiny a few hours later. I don't know if a primer might help prevent the shine.

Thoughts on which LM tint would be better? 3N1 is a good color for me as a muted warm olive. Anything else I should look at? My options are limited as my face hates hyaluronic acid, and it's in so many products these days.",2022-03-29 05:48:20

Makeup,"At 33, I’m not sure where to start with foundation.","Hello everyone! 

As the title says, I’m a little overwhelmed by all the options out there. I’m a 33 year old woman. I’ve never really worn a lot of makeup - I fill my eyebrows everyday, and sometimes curl my eyelashes and wear mascara. If I’m going out, I also wear eye shadow, and a bit of blush. That’s about the extent of it. 

That said, over the last 4 years I’ve had 2 babies and it’s showing on my face. My wrinkles are a little more obvious, my eye circles a little darker and (worst of all!) I have a not-so-subtle « sun mustache ». I’m starting to feel like I would benefit from wearing foundation to even out my skin tone, but I’m concerned because I don’t want to ALSO need to contour and use blush and everything else. I want a foundation that will still allow my freckles to show - kind of like Megan Markle. Would anyone have any suggestions?

Makeup,Foundation for oily but dry skin,"Does anyone else struggle with this issue of having really oily skin but it’s also somehow dry and flaky? I am looking for a light-medium coverage that gives me a little bit of a dewy or slightly shiny finish because I use a setting powder over top of it. Currently, I use a mixture of Covergirl skin milk foundation and FitMe foundation and the finish just doesn’t look…right. I have contemplated buying the Anastasia Beverly Hills foundation as I have tested it on my hand before and it was so smooth and natural looking. Has anyone tried this foundation before?

Makeup,Lash extensions!?!?,"TLDR: Questions listed in bullets at the bottom for people with lash extensions. Pls feel free to answer as few or as many as you like 🙏🙏

Hiyaaa! I've honestly become really interested in eyelash extensions. The idea of having a more natural look with gorgeous lashes to start the day is super appealing &amp; I LOVE how it can look when done in the particular styles I like. However I worry I won't be able to do much more with my makeup if I get extensions. I like wearing different styles of falsies when I go out and enjoy experimenting with different eye/liner looks too. Would lash extensions make that difficult?
Ig I have a few other questions for lash extension people:

- Is it hard to dust off shadow fallout from your extensions?
- Is it hard to clean off your eye makeup with extensions? 
- Is it hard to put in contacts? 
- Did you have to change the way you wash your face?
- How easily do the extensions fall off? 
- Can you swim in lash extensions? 
- Are you able to use mascara with them or can no product touch the extensions at all? 
- If your natural lashes are pretty flat without curling, will the lash extensions also lay flat, can you curl them, or does it change the angle of your lashes when you get extensions? 
- Follow up, if you can't curl your lashes and have straight lashes, can you laminate your lashes + lash extensions? 
- Do they look weird once they start fall off? 
- How long did they last on you? 
- Would you recommend it?",2022-03-30 17:17:58

Makeup,Mixing moisturizer with foundation/BB/CC cream?," 

Hi Reddit.

Recently I have been getting more into skincare than I have makeup but I have found a couple different tinted moisturizers that match my skin tone fairly well! I also have been going to the tanning bed (I know the risks) &amp; so my tinted moisturizer has become a bit too light on my face at its palest vs when I'm at my darkest.

I was wondering if there's a way that works for you when you are pale vs when you are darker &amp; if you mix your moisturizer with foundation or just a BB/CC cream.

Any suggestions/tips are more than welcome! (:",2022-03-31 04:00:04

Makeup,I want to wear makeup but I feel like I don’t look good with it,"I’m 20 years old and I’ve always wanted to walk outside my house with makeup on. But the issue for me is that I have baby face. 

I look really young for my age. I feel that whenever I put makeup on I look like a child who used their mom’s makeup. I definitely lean more towards the natural side of makeup only because if I do anything else, I feel uncomfortable. 

I know how to apply makeup it’s just I don’t have the confidence to wear it out my house. I never have makeup on. Not even a little bit. Not even for occasions. But it definitely would feel nice to wear it once in a while outside.

So my question is, what can I do to help my confidence? And/or what can I do makeup wise that will help flatter my age?

Any advice is greatly appreciated :)",2022-03-31 07:21:19

I tested the foundation once and it looked to be a perfect match, and it looked great when I was putting it on before the photoshoot. I checked my car mirror before we started the shoot and to my horror, it looked darker and pinker than when I initially put it on. It looked like a different color than my neck. I wasn’t able to do anything about it at that point but now I’m just worried how the photos turned out. The thing is, when I took a selfie, it looked like the color matched me perfectly. Will the difference in color show in pictures? Do car mirrors just warp your foundation color in some weird way?? I’m just really stressed about it and wanna hear yalls thoughts

PS yes I realized very soon after that I should’ve tested the foundation longer &amp; practiced before I did it for the shoot; pls don’t make my mistake",2022-03-31 10:44:17

Makeup,Spring skincare Tips,"Hi there! I have brought some spring skincare tips to share for today. 

Before I give you some tips, ‘everyone has their own allergies and problems including different conditions’. Please make sure that these are ‘tips’, not ‘prescriptions’.

Did you know that you can get a shining skin from home without spending $$$ to a dermatologist? These are the secret tips from the staff of dermatologys. 

When spring comes, your skin conditions change, so you need to change your daily routine. 

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Exfoliation** \- LHA cleansing

We all already know about AHA, and BHA cleansers. Now it's time for LHA cleansers. LHA has the smallest particle therefore there is less irritation. For those who have sensitive and acne skin can also use it. It will make your skin smooth and shine. 

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Moisturizing** 

After you finish cleansing, gently wrap your skin with the tower. The moisture inside your skin quickly flies out to the air, so you need to moisture it right away. Use highly moisturizing products such as 'Serumkind - Deep Antarctic Drop', or ' innisfree - Green tea seed serum/cream'.                                                  

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Sunscreen** 

\- During spring the ultraviolet rays are 1.5times stronger than when it is fall. Sunscreen is a must have item for skincare. It is recommended to apply every time you go out and reapply every 2-3 hours. Don't forget to check PA and SPF when you buy the product. In spring SPF50 PA+++ or higher is recommended. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I hope these tips are helpful and hope you all have a wonderful spring skincare routine!",2022-04-01 09:08:28

Makeup,How has your makeup routine changed in the past 5-years?,"I’m constantly amazed with my changing preferences in products, styles, and colours. I know a lot of this has to do with fashion trend cycles, but when I was beating my face to the gods in 2017, I thought some of my constant repurchases would be used until the end of time! Bury me with my Too Faced Palettes, I thought. 

Eyes: 
I was a Kat Von D (now KVD Beauty) Tattoo Liner enthusiast. The perfect, harsh winged liner. This winged obsession hasn’t changed much because I still love a winged liner (partial to the Rare Beauty one currently!), however I’ve also find myself reaching for the Charlotte Tilbury Eye Pencil in Pillow Talk for a more natural wing. I never would have considered anything but a black winged liner 5-years ago— pencils seemed like a thing of the past back then! Now we’ve embraced them again. 

Cheek Products; 
I wore more orange toned blushes and was a fan of Nars Orgasm. Now I prefer bright pops of pink, I really like Milk Makeup’s cream blushes as well as Ilia’s ones. My blush placement is also much higher and I bring it up to my forehead like I used to do with my bronzer. Also my highlighter game (cough cough Becca) will never be as bright as it was then. My cheeks will never look as frosty as they did in 2017. 

Lip Products: 
My relationship with mauve lipsticks was a never ending repurchasing cycle. Urban Decay’s Vice Lipstick in Backtalk owned me. I used to walk down the hill from University during breaks between class just to buy a replacement because that lipstick was my identity. Now with the pandemic it is a bit hard, however I do prefer a more sheer lipstick. I’m currently loving the Fenty ones! I’ve also been use the Milk lip and cheek products. These days, I avoid mauve lipsticks like the plague because I think they really washed me out, especially the cooler toned ones…

Tools: 
When did my fingers become the new brushes and sponge???? I really like products from rms beauty where I can really feel and mould the cream products (eg. their concealer that I use religiously). My entire beauty collection was inspired by influencers, which included a multitude of brushes and sponges (tools I do still use, but I’m far less rigid about it when so many of the products I use, benefit from a lighter hand (literally!) 

These are the things I’m constantly thinking about as my makeup routine has evolved and changed. Has anyone else had changes you just couldn’t see yourself having 5-years ago???? It’s currently almost 1am in New Zealand, so yes these are my late night shower thoughts.",2022-04-01 19:47:15

Makeup,"Looking for light coverage, seamless blending foundation/tinted moisturizer. *Natural finish*","I’ve been on the hunt for a holy grail, natural looking, light coverage product for years and just haven’t found the right combo.

I’ve read through a ton of previous posts on here about mixing bases (water vs oil), application (sponge, fingers, brush), and layering (serums, moisturizers, makeup). 

I’m struggling with any and all product looking patchy/spotty throughout the day. I’ve tried 4 different setting powders and countless foundations/tinted moisturizers.

I think I have normal/combo skin but with some redness and fairly large pores. I exfoliate, I use a light moisturizer and give it time to soak in before applying makeup. I’ve tried setting sprays. I feel like I’ve tried every combo/order of application.

I’m looking for a seamless blend, natural finish product. The formulas that have come the closest would be Saie Slip Tint (but it looks greasy without a powder, or eventually looks spotty/separates with a powder), Tower 28 (eventually separates, looks a bit flakey with powder) and the Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Filter - (but it’s a glowy finish - not what I’m after). 

Setting powders I’ve tried: IT cosmetics (pressed), Glossier (loose), Bare Minerals (pressed and loose). ***Are these the problem?? 

I don’t want to look greasy or completely matte. Just natural, no makeup look.

Makeup,Can you help a mom figure out makeup?,"I'm a stay-at-home parent for the last 10 years.  Pre-pandemic, I used drug store makeups.  During the pandemic, I stopped wearing makeup all together.  Most of my peers are low-to-no-makeup wearers.  And I missed that part of girlhood where you learn how-to makeup (grew up rural, went to mid-western colleges). 

So!  I'm asking for advice!  Where should a mom go to get some basic advice on day-to-day make up?  Or to have someone walk me through all these new products.  I'm a gen x person, so I'm imagining a department store make up counter, but that is like two generations ago.  And like I said, most of my peers don't wear much.

My goals are to find a simple face for the few times I need to look more put together.  Church volunteer work. Leading activities with my kid's social groups.  And to find something slightly more dramatic for some of my mom's nights out and date nights.  (Nothing wild, just darker eyeliner and a heavier lip.)

Makeup,App for skin tone detection and search for matching products,"A few months ago, my wife shared how difficult it might be to find the right foundation tone: whatever she orders online, she buys a few samples and eventually throws away those that do not work. Especially during COVID-19 lockdown - you cannot try it out in the shop. 

As a software engineer, I decided to challenge myself and try to create an app to help figure out skin tone and match foundation products. I have just released the first version, available on [iOS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/RTVeujpW) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unotone) \- [http://unotone.com/](http://unotone.com/).  The app flow is quite simple: 

1. Take a photo of your skin, then crop the desired skin fragment.

2. After analyzing your skin tone, the app suggests several tone samples. 

3. Click on a sample from the list that best matches your skin tone. 

3. The app will find a foundation product that perfectly suits your skin color. 

Luckily for me,  my wife doesn't buy so many foundations to test if app detection works very well, so I would be happy to have feedback from you. Let me know if you'll be able to find a perfect match; what you would like to add or change. 

Thank you in advance!",2022-04-02 22:21:08

Makeup,Makeup mirror frustration?? Sick of leaning over my sink.,"Why are mirrors designed for makeup application so limited?? Based on searches, it looks like at least around half of us stand to put on our makeup. But there's such a limited mirror selection for anyone who stands and it's honestly kind of ridiculous. 
I think a ton of us lean over our sinks, and it's just dumb. 
My back hurts. 

Our Makeup Mirror Options: 

Option 1: 

Sit! There's 7532578 mirror options for those who have a dedicated vanity! 
Oh you don't have the space and/or money for an entirely dedicated makeup vanity? Or maybe that just seems a little excessive for your style? Oh... Uh...? Hm.

Option 2:

Wall mounted vanity mirrors:

1) Basically shows 90% of your face on one side because you're only gonna ever wanna be 90% ready looking at best, amiright?? 
The other side of the mirror:
This option affords you the ability to see the deepest darkest depths of every grueling detail of your face so you can finally see into the epic future of the cells and golden triangle ratios of all the science inside your face. 
Also check out that speck of dust from 2017 still chillin in your nose pore ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ

2) Vertically adjustable? Why? You're only one height.
You just have to *perfectly* mount it to your *exact* height Np! Uh... you want to share it with another makeup user...? Have shoes on of varying height? Or maybe you worked out hard that day and you're actually a little bit shorter...?? No. Not allowed. Only perfectly mounted to your one exact height right now, and don't screw it up; it's holes in your wall. 

3) If you want one of either of the previous options, cool! You can pick only one... but then whatever lighting you got going on, good luck! :D 

4) Indecisive? That's okay, there's 4000 options that vary only by 3 degrees, so as long as you know what CoLoR you want, you're good! 


Option 3:

Countertop mirrors:
You... Stand? You sure you don't want to double over? Or look up at your face like you flipped your phone camera? Are you *REALLY* sure...? 


Honestly, how are there so many identical copies of a super mediocre product when there are so many ways of easily improving on this.

I have powdered highlighter that’s matte but would like a cream. Mary Kay used to make one that was perfect but it was discontinued and I’ve been buying it on eBay but it’s getting difficult to find so wondered if anyone had any recommendations.

Makeup,I want a foundation with the right base to work with Lancome La Base,"Hi. I have Lancome La Base primer and I believe it has a silicone base. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

What is a nice full-coverage foundation that will have a matching base?

I tried using it with Loreal Infallible 24H and I think that might have a water base because they didn't seem to meld well.

I used the YSL All Hours foundation in the past and I liked it, but I don't know what the base is and I can't figure it out. Would it work with Lancome La Base?

Open to suggestions at drug store, mid-range, or even high end prices. My skin tone is ligh-medium so most lines have something that will fit me.",2022-02-25 01:39:57

Makeup,Top 5 Favorite - Lip Liners,"[Pictures are available on my profile, if you are interested!]

COMMENT 1
---------------------
✴ TOP 5 Favorites - Lip Liners‼ 

...... 

➡️ NOTE: the information contained within this post is based upon my research, opinions, and experience. As always, buy/use the products that make YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun. 

...... 

🔹️PURPOSE: within this series, I really want to accomplish manifying the products in my collection (by category) that have truly stood out to me, &amp; ones that I keep returning to over-and-over again. 

...... 

For this fifth installment, I thought it might be fun to move from brow pencils to another form of pencil product - lip liners. I prefer a lip liner with the following features: it should have a naturally smooth, gel-like type formula, I don't want to experience any skipping as I draw an uninterrupted line, I like for it to be extremely long-lasting, I want the perfect balance between creaminess and tenacity. This balances provides for the ultimate wear, and lastly I do not discriminate between brand classification - I use both affordable AND high-end products. 


Likewise, there are also aspects of a lip liner that best are described as a 'deterrence', which I actively avoid: any very stiffly tipped liner, mostly automatic liners in general, a liner that feels unusually creamy, as I find these to smear outside of the lip lines, and essentially all liners that I find to be awkward or inconvenient. 


I'm certain of your awareness of the full-rainbow of vibrantly-colored lip liner options available on the market, but my most-popular liners are all in the neutral category. I know these are seemingly 'very boring' colors, but this is truly what I reach for the most during my every day makeup routine. I do own (and further enjoy) an assortment of bright, bold colors - but I find my deliberate use very infrequent. 


Please read on below to check-out my 'TOP 5 MOST-FAVORITE' (in order from least to greatest) lip liners in my entire current collection &amp; why: 

...... 

‼ ELUCIDATION (pertaining to lip liners, in specific): 


+ This series entails my CURRENT 'Top 5' picks. These selections are subject to change as my collection evolves. I will make it my duty to update this list as necessary. 


+ This determined list is both about formula as well as shade. I chose these particular products because both aspects work positively in my favor. 


+ The way that I USUALLY utilize a lip liner, is to forcibly 'correct' the asymmetry of my natural lip line. I also sometimes will use a lip liner as a solo lip product if I'm in a rush. 


+ Lastly, for this entire account, I did not attempt to strategically and perfectly apply these liners for the 'demo pictures'. I know my application looks messy and doesn't help revamp the shape in any regard - so, no need to additionally point this out, as I'm already utterly aware! 

...... 

🏅 Lip Liner #5 - fifth place 

| Huda Beauty - Lip Contour | 

+ THE SCOPE: I've always heard amazing things about this liner, so I felt compelled to add it to my collection. I became enamored with this liner immediately after my first time trying it! 

+ SHADE NAME: bombshell 

+ SHADE DESCRIPTION: peachy mauve 

+ TONAL FAMILY: warmer tone 

+ PRICE: $19.00 

+ ACQUIRED: purchased from the BoxyCharm Add-On sales event 

+ ACCESSIBILITY: average availability; can be found at Sephora, the Huda Beauty brand website, and Cult Beauty. 

+ APPLIANCE: very smooth, and an even layer 

+ SUITABLE FOR SOLO WEAR: yes; however the tip dulls very quickly when used in this manner. 

+ REMOVAL: difficult; used micellar water 

////// [exclusive unit probe]: 

+ UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES: there is nothing special regarding this assembly - it's simply just a capped pencil liner. 

+ PRODUCT SCENT: none 

+ SHARPENING QUALITY: this sharpens solidly, creating a super precision tip. 

...... 

🏅 Lip Liner #4 - fourth place 

| Charlotte Tilbury - Lip Cheat Re-Shape &amp; Re-Size Lip Liner | 

+ THE SCOPE: this is an absolute iconic shade, so I really wanted this in my collection. I frequently wear this liner paired with its matching lipstick counterpart. This is the perfect every day hint of color. 

+ SHADE NAME: pillow talk 

+ SHADE DESCRIPTION: rosey pink 

+ TONAL FAMILY: warmer tone 

+ PRICE: $24.00 

+ ACQUIRED: purchased from Sephora 

+ ACCESSIBILITY: maximum availability; can find it on the Charlotte Tilbury brand website, Sephora, Nordstrom, Beautylish, and Bloomingdale's. 

+ APPLIANCE: very smooth, and an even layer 

+ SUITABLE FOR SOLO WEAR: no, this is an incredibly fragile liner formula, and it is prone to repetitive full-tip breaks when used on a larger area. The tip also dulls very quickly when used in this manner. 

+ REMOVAL: easy; used micellar water 

////// [exclusive unit probe]: 

+ UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES: there is nothing special regarding this assembly - it's simply just a capped pencil liner. 

+ PRODUCT SCENT: a very light, generic 'pencil' scent 

+ SHARPENING QUALITY: this sharpens solidly, creating a super precision tip.

...... 

🥉 Lip Liner #3 - third place 

| NYX Cosmetics - Slide On, Glide On, Stay On &amp; Definitely A Turn On, Waterproof, Extreme Color Lip Liner | 

+ THE SCOPE: I specifically purchased this by recommendation of Allie Glines. This is one of her favorite shades, and as soon as I used it - I instantly fell in love. 

+ SHADE NAME: nude suede shoes 

+ SHADE DESCRIPTION: soft pale lilac 

+ TONAL FAMILY: very cool tone 

+ PRICE: $8.00 

+ ACQUIRED: purchased from Walmart 

+ ACCESSIBILITY: maximum availability; can find it at Ulta, the NYX brand website, Walmart, Target, and Amazon. 

+ APPLIANCE: very smooth, and an even layer 

+ SUITABLE FOR SOLO WEAR: no; this shade (to me) looks awkward worn alone. I usually use this liner as a surface building product, or simply as an overall liner. If you want to wear it alone, the tip stays fairly precise when applying it in this manner. 

+ REMOVAL: difficult; used micellar water 

////// [exclusive unit probe]: 

+ UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES: there is nothing special regarding this assembly - it's simply just a capped pencil liner. 

+ PRODUCT SCENT: a very light, generic 'pencil' scent 

+ SHARPENING QUALITY: this sharpens solidly, creating a super precision tip. 

...... 

🥈 Lip Liner #2 - second place 

| KKW Beauty - Lip Liner | 

+ THE SCOPE: I honestly love everything about this liner. I especially like that it's super-easy to thoughtlessly apply in a rush. 

+ SHADE NAME: classic icon 

+ SHADE DESCRIPTION: rosey lavender 

+ TONAL FAMILY: very cool tone 

+ PRICE: $12.00 

+ ACQUIRED: purchased from Ulta 

+ ACCESSIBILITY: limited availability; this brand is currently restructuring, so their products are widely (currently) unavailable, however I did find some on Mercari. 

+ APPLIANCE: very smooth, and an even layer 

+ SUITABLE FOR SOLO WEAR: yes; the tip stays fairly precise while applying it in this manner. 

+ REMOVAL: easy; used micellar water 

////// [exclusive unit probe]: 

+ UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES: there is nothing special regarding this assembly - it's simply just a capped pencil liner. 

+ PRODUCT SCENT: none 

+ SHARPENING QUALITY: never sharpens correctly, always results in a loose tip 

...... 

🥇 Lip Liner #1 - first place 

| Lottie London - Slay All Day Lip Liner Pencil | 

+ THE SCOPE: this is hands-down my most-used and best-loved liner. I wear this alone all the time! Also, this shade is so universal that I find it to conveniently pair with a TON of my lipstick shades. 

+ SHADE NAME: fleek 

+ SHADE DESCRIPTION: light mauve 

+ TONAL FAMILY: warmer tone 

+ PRICE: $6.50 

+ ACQUIRED: fairly certain I received in Ipsy 

+ ACCESSIBILITY: limited availability; unfortunately, this product appears to have been completely discontinued! My heart just broke. There are two shades still stocked on the ASOS website. 

+ APPLIANCE: sadly, my liner is applying to be kind of old-feeling and drier than normal. The actual fresh formula is unparalleled in its formula. 

+ SUITABLE FOR SOLO WEAR: yes; but the liner dulls quite fast used in this manner. 

+ REMOVAL: easy; used micellar water 

////// [exclusive unit probe]: 

+ UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES: there is nothing special regarding this assembly - it's simply just a capped pencil liner. 

+ PRODUCT SCENT: slight plastic scent 

+ SHARPENING QUALITY: never sharpens correctly, always results in a loose tip

Makeup,Dupe for Colourpop’s “Brink” lippie stix,"I just saw another post looking for dupes and I realized I could post here as well! 

I love Colourpops Brink, but can’t use their lippie stix since I’m allergic to soy. I’ve been looking for a dupe forever but can’t seem to find one that hits just right.
(I did buy the Brink lip pencil, which does not contain soy, but it’s not really the same colour as the lippie stix. 

Does anyone have any suggestions? So far I’ve only searched YouTube and Google pics, as well as swatched different brands like a crazy person in stores.

It doesn’t have to be the same finish; it’s the colour I want! Liquid lips, lip glosses, pigmented balms, lipsticks, pencils -anything goes! Maybe even an eyeshadow/blush pigment I could mix with Vaseline?!",2022-02-25 16:53:02

Makeup,Would you buy nearly 30-year-old eyeshadow?,"A nostalgia group I belong to mentioned Clarion lipstick, and I realized it was a brand name I haven't heard in a very long time. So I decided to Google it, and one of the first few links was a press release that Proctor &amp; Gamble was phasing the unprofitable line out... by 1995.

And then right under it was an Amazon link to Clarion eyeshadow still being sold for $2.99 on the site. Still in original sealed packaging, but at least two of the reviews mentioned that the applicator crumbled as soon as it came out of the package. (Wasn't sure I could link to it, but search ""Clarion Wedgewood"" in Amazon for the listing.) The seller still had seven compacts available.

It didn't come with an expiration date, but Amazon generally only allows a 900 to 1,825-day shelf life for cosmetics shipped from its warehouse. I don't know if that holds true for sellers who directly ship.

I know buying old perfume is fairly commonplace for the nostalgia factor, but do people actively seek out 30-year-old makeup if it was a discontinued brand they enjoyed? (I feel like I'm getting a stye just imagining it. I don't buy makeup from Amazon because I'm already leery of fake products.)",2022-02-26 03:53:09

Makeup,Alternative eyeliners that won't cause a reaction??,"Hello! I have a serious question for anyone who can help me, please. I love wearing eyeliner but I have not been able to wear any for a few years. About 2 years ago, whenever I would apply eyeliner I would get a reaction, not too sure if it is an allergic reaction or what, but my eyes would water and my nose would become runny for the entire day. Like an annoying amount to where it smeared my eyeliner from the tears and wouldn't end until I thoroughly cleaned my eyes and face, completely removing the eyeliner. Is that an allergic reaction? My eyes would also get a little red and irriated. Anyways, my real question is, is there ANY kind of eyeliner I could use that wouldn't cause that type of reaction? I don't mind paying a pretty penny. I usually use the cheaper brands like Maybelline, or others that were usually around $10-$12. I REALLY want to start wearing eyeliner again!

Makeup,Best lip liner to go with Burts Bees tinted lip balm?,"I’m looking for a good lip liner to go with Burts Bees tinted lip balm in the shade Red Dahlia. I don’t really like noticeable makeup, just really natural looks like mascara, lip tint/gloss, and maybe a bit of eyeliner if I feel like it or natural looking eyeshadow. I really like the Burts Bees tinted lip balm because of how natural it looks, but I feel like it would be even better with a bit of lip liner but I’ve never used lip liner before so I don’t know where to begin looking. I’m not really looking for anything that pigmented, or bold.

Makeup,Catastrophe!! My favorite foundation was discontinued and I need a replacement!,"It's a sad, sad tale. I have always had a difficult time color matching my foundation. I have been EVERYWHERE. Sephora, Ulta, MAC, ect. I have tried drugstore and designer foundation. Almost every shade either looks too orange, too pink, or too dead and I have hopped from brand to brand trying to find the perfect match. And a year or so ago, I did. 

Tartes Rainforest of the Sea Water foundation in 12N was perfect! It matched my skin perfectly. It had great coverage, great weigh, a gorgeous finish and I was in love with it. A couple months ago I was running low and went back to get more. ITS DISCONTINUED and the worst part is that the shade it was in is DIFFERENT THAN THEIR OTHER FOUNDATIONS. The 12N of the water foundation isn't the same as the 12N if the other ones. I've been using the Sea Hydroflex foundation as a replacement but it's not the same. Now the empty bottle of water foundation sits on my shelf like an effigy to the perfect match I'll never have again. 

Dramatics aside, does anyone have a good dupe? The shade 12N was described as Fair Neutral so I think I might just have really neutral skin and most shades lean cool or warm but idk. I loved that specific color and the fact that it was so light and moisturizing.",2022-02-26 14:49:41

Makeup,Palette Review &amp; Pictorial - Urban Decay: Naked Honey,"[Pictures are available on my profile, if you are interested!]
------------------------- 

✅  Saturday Palette Review &amp; Pictorial 🤓 

...... 

➡️ NOTE: the information contained within this post is based upon my research, opinions, and experience. As always, buy/use the products that make YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun. 

...... 

🔺️ PALETTE: Urban Decay - Naked Honey Palette✌ 

...... 

🔺️ ACQUIRED: purchased myself through Amazon 

...... 

👁 LOOK CREATED: 'Standard Transitional Style' 

...... 

▪️ PACKAGING &amp; DESIGN: 12 shades are 0.95g each, upright rectangular-shaped pans, luxury plastic case packaging w/ 3D details, bi-fold, palette name &amp; brand is on cover, mid-weight, magnetic closure, medium rectangular shape, large-size mirror inside, tried a heavy magnet &amp; pans are NOT removable, shade names are designated southwards of each shadow 


🔊 NOTICE: 

+ At 0.95g, each shadow weighs BELOW the average amount per pan. I don't think anybody would find difficulty in storing this palette. 

...... 

▪️ COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: China 

...... 

▪️ TOTAL # OF SHADES: 12 (all eyeshadows, which are deemed safe by the FDA for use around the eye area) 

...... 

▪️ TYPES OF FORMULAS: 3 formulas (1 satin, 6 mattes, 5 shimmers) 

...... 

▪️ DESIGNATION: yellow-undertoned neutral 

...... 

▪️ DEXTERITY CONCERNS: none 

...... 

▪️ DESCRIPTION OF SHADE PRESS: soft/moderate/hard - there is no universal press to these shades; recommend doing eyes before base with this palette 

...... 

▪️ EXTRA PERTINENT INFORMATION: the inspiration behind the creation of this palette was the 'honeybee', supposedly complementary of all skin tones, eye colors, and eye shapes, palette includes a double-ended eyeshadow brush, supposedly creates the 'perfect' '70's statement eye look. 

...... 

✅ ROUTINE DATA CHECK: 

+ not clarified as being a clean formula 

+ cruelty-free 

+ NOT vegan 

+ 24-M PAO (located on back of palette) 

...... 

🔍 COST EVALUATION: (Ulta Beauty) 

💲 $49.00 / palette 

💲 $4.08 / shade 

💲 $4.30 / gram 

...... 

♦️ PRICE PER SHADE SCALE: 

&lt;$2=excellent; $3-$4=affordable; $5-$8=meh; $9-$15=expensive; &gt;$16=very expensive 


• Comparing this palette to similar products available on the market, the price per shade is 'affordable, on the verge of being a little too steep'. Additionally, this palette has an EXPENSIVE cost per gram compared  to other palettes I've previously reviewed. 

......


🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️PATCHINESS: no patchiness 


🔸️BLENDABILITY: very easy to blend out, no harsh lines 


🔸️KICK-BACK/FALL-OUT: 


+ some shades had no kick-back, some had just a little bit, and some shades had a lot 


+ experienced some fall-out, the most being from matte shade 'Sting'. 


🔸️COLOR-STORY CRITIQUE: 


+ this palette inholds the nice 'light-to-dark' gradient that I always look for. The included shades range from light to midtone to deep. There is only one deep shade (to create depth in your look), which severely limits the types/amount of looks you can create. 


+ there are a broad range of neutral transition shades included in this particular color-story, &amp; they may perhaps work for a variety of skintones. 


+ the formula balance ratio in this palette is 6:6 (mattes to non-mattes), &amp; I think a 50% / 50% formula split is definitely balanced, &amp; provides enough range-of-use. 


+ I classify this as a yellow-undertoned neutral palette, &amp; I don't own another palette similar to this color-story. 


+ there is NOT a matte black in this palette, which I always prefer - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. 


+ throughout exploring this palette, I didn't encounter any 'dud' shades. 


🔸️FORMULA EVALUATION: 

// 

+ | MATTES |: 

• this matte formula performed beyond my expectations 

• it's outstanding for gradients &amp; layering 

• it blended out extremely easily, without creating harsh lines in the process 

• there was no issue trying to build them to achieve maximum potential 

• this is a more 'buildable' formula (in lieu of being 'directly pigmented'), making it easier to manage and control. 

// 

+ | SATIN |: 

• there is only ONE satin shade 

• it is very light-in-tone, and has a slight sheen finish 

• I think due to its finish, it serves as a multifunctional shade - it can be used to highlight, or even blur edges 

• this shade blended out perfectly 

// 

+ | SHIMMERS |: 

• I prefer using this particular formula WET 

• each one bears a uniquely different tone, allowing you to have more versatility in your looks 

• very uniform application 

• when used wet, applies like liquid metal 

• works fine with a dry brush or finger, works BEST with a dampened brush 

...... 

🔸️PACKAGING: 

+ I do believe that the cover design/art is truly reminiscent of the interior color-story, being the golden/yellow undertone of the whole thing. 


+ I think this packaging style is overall a great representation of the brand, and similar to previous palettes in the series. 


+ I personally really like this type of packaging (plastic casing), as it offers the utmost protection of the fragile shadows contained within 

...... 

🔸️RECOMMENDATION: I kinda felt like doing something simple today, but also something reliable. This is one of my go-to looks when testing out a new palette, because it truly allows me to experiment with all of the different formulas. I've been holding off on reviewing this palette for MONTHS, as I wanted to have the 'right inspiration' for it. Well, today was that day - and I just adore every single thing about it! It has amazing reviews (on several websites), and I totally get what the hype is all about! I am sooo glad to have this palette in my collection, and I predict I will call upon this palette frequently, as a means for my every day, routine looks! 

...... 

▪️FINAL CONCLUSION: (recommend) 

+ extraordinary blendability 

+ liquid metal shimmer formula (wet) 

+ great for honeybee-lovers (like me!) 

...... 

+ Favorite Shade: Golden 

- Least Favorite Shade: Queen 

...... 

🚦 RATING: A 

...... 

⭐ RATING LEGEND: 

A = totally wow'd me 

B = not the best, but I like it 

C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product 

D = this didn't work out for me 

F = I totally hate this 

......

Makeup,Tubing Mascara for VERY fine lashes?,"Good morning/day/evening wherever you might be,

To this point Benefit's Roller Lash has been my HG of mascara largely, I believe, due to the wand and the formula.  I have incredibly (baby fine) hair on my head and my eyelashes, while very long and naturally somewhat curled are also incredibly fine and it seems like every mascara I've used tends to droop them quickly.

Also, all mascaras flake off through the day here and there, and this gets into my eyes and under my contact lenses and causes insane amounts of pain and frustration with diminished sight.  (Mascara is the last thing to go on after everything else including setting spray.)  

I saw a post recently about tubing mascara and though this might be an option for me to try but I'm concerned about the applicators.  The silicone-types with tiny bristles seem to do the best for me as far as not clumping my superfine lashes together.  

Can anyone recommend a tubing mascara option that might fit the bill or have similar experience they could share?

Another question - I wear mascara and found my HG which is Maybelline Lash Sensational. Because I don’t wear concealer under eyes, not yet, do I need to use a setting spray on the mascara to prevent flakes? This mascara rarely smudges because my eyelids are not oily but I wear glasses and I have long lashes so some flakes are inevitable.

The skin on most of my body is a yellowish greenish beige but I have a lot of redness in my face so I wasn’t sure which one to match. BUT after finally settling on neutral, someone in the color analysis subreddit said that the vein thing isn’t useful, that neutral doesn’t really exist, AND that overtone and undertone are different and u can have a warm overtone and cool undertone (I thought this is what neutral was) which just confused me a lot more.

Makeup,Foundation wear test— why do influencers use heavy concealer overtop!?,"This just has been bothering while I’ve been looking up some foundation wear tests on oily skin (bite beauty, UD naked skin, L’Oréal serum). YouTubers will take a light coverage skin like foundation and then after they give you a few thoughts about application— they cut to the part where they apply a medium/full coverage concealer on the sides of their eye, under, along the bridge of the nose! Basically everywhere.

This ruins the wear test. I feel like a wear test should just be product no primer, just the foundation. And maybe day 2 with primer and setting powder. I think stephs beauty stash does it this way— but she also mixes product. Esp when YTers are trying two new products with first impressions—a foundation and then try a new concealer overtop! To try and make multiple videos for the same face. 

Just some thoughts.",2022-02-28 07:09:05

Makeup,Looking for advice on doing my own makeup for my wedding,"I don’t normally wear makeup in the last few years, but I have in the past so I’m familiar enough with it. I generally like a very natural look, I’m too fair to pull off black eyeliner and generally go with brownish black for mascara and liner (I am horrible at liner currently though). In the past I used a Mac foundation, more recently just cc cream which I’m not sure would be enough for photos/all day wear for the big day. I do brow stuff and bronzer sometimes as well, and that’s about where it ends for me. 

I have 8 months to figure this out. Am I out of my mind to think I can pull this off on my own? I’m just after such a natural/minimal look it seems unnecessary to hire someone, but I could be wrong. If anyone has any advice or resources I’d be super grateful! Thanks.",2022-02-28 07:41:04

Makeup,Home Remedies For Beautiful Skin - Retain the desired look,"The skin care products have flooded the consumer market these days. These products claim to improve every aspect of the skin needs. In addition, many products claim to be multifunctional while many other products are meant for single need, for instance fairness. But, unfortunately these products are only useful when they are used continually; whereas the home remedies for beautiful skin helps to repair the skin, and fulfill the needs of the skin naturally. Moreover, the skin care products in the market are unable to solve skin problems unless you use them regularly. But, once you discontinue these so called miraculous skin products, your skin turns as it was before. The home remedies for beautiful skin not only helps to retain the desired look but, also it helps the skin to be beautiful even when these remedies are discontinued.

[Click Here to know about how you can maintain Healthy and Glowing Skin](https://sites.google.com/view/hydrossential-serum-1/home)

The skin cannot turn to be beautiful unless it is treated with different ingredients which may help to increase the needed nutritional needs of the healthy skin. Moreover, the skin is the only part of the body which receives the maximum exposure. That is why, it is important to protect and pamper the skin in order to keep it healthy and beautiful. The home remedies for beautiful skin help the skin to retain its natural health and thus, keeps it beautiful. The skin care products can burn a hole in the pocket of the consumers without guaranteeing the desired result. But, the home remedies for beautiful skin is inexpensive, and the ingredients for these remedies are available right into the kitchen of every home. Some of the effective home remedies for beautiful skin are mentioned ahead.

1. Exfoliating the skin is very necessary because it removes the dead skin cells, toxins and other harmful deposits that may be responsible for your skin problems. Take one-fourth cup of table salt in a bowl. Add olive oil in the bowl until it covers the salt. Stir the solution, and gently rub this scrub all over your body. Later rinse thoroughly.

2. Moisturizing is also very necessary, to keep skin soft and smooth. Mix one-third cup of oatmeal in half cup of hot water. Stir the mixture, and allow it to thicken. Prepare another mixture by thoroughly mixing 2 tablespoons of honey, 2 tablespoons of plain yoghurt and 1 egg white. Now, combine both mixtures and blend properly. Apply this mixture on face for 15 minutes. Rinse the face with warm water.

3. Cleansing the skin is also an important part of home remedies for beautiful skin. Mix equal amounts of honey and plain yoghurt. Apply this mixture on face for 15 minutes. Rinse with warm water.

4. A Body buffer is a fantastic way to moisturize the skin, but it is expensive in salons. Prepare one at home by mixing 4 ounces of each jojoba oil and shea butter with 3 teaspoons of any essential oil, and 1 ounce of beeswax.

5. Lips are most sensitive parts of the body. Combine 4 ounces of each shea butter, and sweet almond oil with 1 tablespoon of beeswax, and melt them together. When the mixture cools down, apply it on lips for 15 minutes.

Makeup,Eyebrow gel causing eyebrow hair loss?,"Hello
I’ve recently started using cover girl easy breezy brow these last two weeks and I thought it was amazing because it would give me a natural fluffy eyebrow look with only a few swipes. Plus my brow hair wouldn’t budge for the whole day but I’ve noticed that when I remove the makeup at night that there were quite a few eyebrow hairs on the makeup wipe or cotton pad. I’ve never seen this much of my eyebrow hair on the pad when I’ve finished removing the makeup before and it’s never this much when I use a regular brow pencil or pen. I’m worried that if I continue using this that my eyebrows will become sparse. Are there any good gels out there that won’t harden the brow to where a lot of hairs fall off at removal? When I remove I use a makeup remover wipe or a micellar cleansing water on a cotton pad and leave it on my brow for a little before I wipe and even then I’ve seen a lot of eyebrow hairs coming out 😓 any help, tips or makeup recommendations would be appreciated.",2022-03-02 02:17:32

I recently bought the Armani luminous silk foundation after reading so many great reviews and seeing pictures of how great it looks on people but I can’t seem to get it to work for me? I’ve tried it a couple of times and feel like I have to use three pumps which seems way too much just to get it all to cover my face and have some coverage, and then it tends to stick to dry areas. I do love how lightweight it feels though, which is a big thing for me. I saw reviews saying all you need is one pump, so I tried that this morning and it was difficult getting it to cover everywhere. It looks ok, basically no coverage. I’ve tried it with a beauty blender, flat foundation brush and a buffing foundation brush, and tried three different primers. It just seems very meh to me. 
Does anyone have any advice or similar experience? I really wanted to love this foundation but feeling disappointed :(",2022-03-02 16:17:51

Makeup,Old MAC Warm Soul dupe or Availability?,"Hi everyone,

I first purchased MAC Warm Soul years ago, I think when I was around 15. It’s the absolute PERFECT colour - I have many variations of other makeup products but to date this is the only blusher I own as it’s just so perfect on my NC 20 skin. But, after almost eight years of use I’m understandably running low so went to repurchase only to find out the product has been reformulated! 

I’m dying to find a dupe so please share any recommendations if you have them or if anybody has an unused old formula Warm Soul please private message me as I’d be interested to buy it. 

Thank you!",2022-03-02 18:19:15

I recently got gifted 3 little eyeshow palettes from my best friend. Untill now I've always worn just mascara and some gold/bronze-ish eyeshadow (to make me look more awake lol)

I love experimenting with all the colours, but I was wondering if anyone could tell me about the basics; how do I make the pigmentation better, what's the best way to apply it etc. 

Also, do you all have 10000 brushes one for each colour or do you clean the brushes between every colour, if so; how? 

I do not want to wear makeup other than on my eyes. Eyeliner doesn't work on my eyeshape (my upper eyelid is big, it somehow gets all makeup in the crease). Can't seem to find tutorials for just the eyes haha.",2022-03-02 19:26:48

Makeup,Complimentary eyelid &amp; transition shades - help please,"When I first started getting into make up a few years ago, I was advised to choose a transition shade that was lighter than my eyelid colour (and ideally close to my skin tone) so that it blended into my skin better - so if I wanted a deep blue on my eyelid then I will choose a light blue for the transition shade.

Makeup,In Search of the best Eyebrow Product,"Hi, everyone!
Recently, I've been trying to look for a new eyebrow product that's cruelty-free since I finished up my L'Oreal Paris Brow Stylist Sculptor Pencil. It was honestly one of the best products I've ever used for my eyebrows since it was super pigmented, very easy to apply, lasted all day on my face, and lasted a long time in general. I have an issue with finding good eyebrow products since my eyebrows are quite light and my hair is a very dark brown. So, I decided to just buy a bunch of different products, try them out for a bit, and see if I like them. Here's what I've tried so far:

1. Elf Cosmetics Instant Lift Brow Pencil (https://www.ulta.com/p/instant-lift-brow-pencil-xlsImpprod14521105)
This eyebrow pencil is pretty good. I got it in Deep Brown about 3 weeks ago. I used it everyday and I'm just about to be done with it so that's not a crazy long lifespan. It was a very affordable option, though, and the pigment liner was decently sized. I will say that the color is not the best since it shows up as a grey-brown on my brows, especially when I've put concealer on. I would say 6.5/10

2. Elf Cosmetics Wow Brow Gel (https://www.ulta.com/p/wow-brow-gel-pimprod2003078)
I got this around the same time as the brow pencil. I don't use it very much though. I think this product is very good if you have very thick eyebrows and want something to kind of hold them in place and give them a little bit of pigment. For me, though, it doesn't really do anything. It's nice though and stays on all day. I would say 6/10, but I'm not really the audience for this product.

3. L.A. Colors On Point Brow Pencil ( https://www.lacolors.com/products/on-point-brow-pencil?variant=19849326166070)
I got this around 1.5ish years ago in Dark Brown, and I'm just about done with it. It was pretty affordable at $2.00. It was waxier than other pencils I've tried though and also had like a grey tone on my face. I would say 5/10.

4. Wet'N'Wild Ultimate Brow Micro Brow Pencil (https://www.wetnwildbeauty.com/ultimate-browtm-micro-brow-pencil.html)
I got this one a couple years ago in Deep Brown, and I'm not really a fan. It's super tiny and the lead breaks really easily. Also not a whole ton of product. I honestly forgot about it until I was cleaning out my makeup bag. The color is nice though. 4.5/10.

But those are the ones I've tried. If you guys have any suggestions for good eyebrow products, please let me know!",2022-03-03 08:31:14

Makeup,Primer Advice - My favourite primer is discontinued,"My favourite primer - the Urban Decay Optical Illusion primer is discontinued. I'm almost out and I need to find a new primer. What I liked about this primer: It filled out my pores; evened out my skin tone a bit; played really well with my make-up and caused no creases and helped with longevity; a little went a long way so I didn't need to buy a new primer every few weeks or months and was thus perfect to use all over my face. I liked that on no-make-up days I could put on the primer and get nicer looking skin.   


I don't mind spending a bit more on a new primer, as long as it's good and will last me a while. I would like a primer that fills up the pores and creases in my skin and makes my makeup a bit more long-lasting. I'd also like it to work well with my oily skin. It doesn't necessarily need to be mattifying, but super hydrating formulas generally don't work very well for me.

Makeup,The most non-waterproof/ easily removable makeup products?,"Hello!

To keep a long story short, I have always had quite nice skin, that was until I got into skincare, specifically cleansers. Turns out that my skin cannot handle cleansers, most surfactants and even emulsifiers not only make me break out, but literally give me contact dermatitis. I have tried at least 20 cleansers, same reaction every time, even with micellar water or oil cleansers. This has left me with a broken moisture barrier and extremely dehydrated skin. Multiple dermatologists have advised me to wash my face with water only, which makes it hard to wear makeup of course. I would have even gone with makeup wipes, but in my few past experiences with them they have always stung or burnt my skin.

I have finally found a cream/milk cleanser without surfactants that my skin tolerates. However, it’s cleansing power is not that great.

I would love to start wearing a little bit of makeup, but I’m afraid of not removing it properly. I have tested the Shiseido future solution lx foundation (which I know has mineral spf filters which makes it especially hard to remove) on the back of my hand and tried to double cleanse with my milk cleanser. It got rid of a surprisingly big amount, however after I double checked with the Clinique TTDO cleansing oil and a cotton pad, there was still more residue left than I would be comfortable with.

Which leads me to my question: what are some of the most non-waterproof/ easily removable makeup products that you know? I usually don’t sweat or do any activities that would compromise the makeup, so that is not an issue. I’m a complete makeup newby and specifically looking for products such as blush, bronzer or highlighter. Are powder or cream products generally better for my problem? Any specific recommendations? 

Any help or recommendations would be beyond appreciated, thank you for your help :)",2022-03-03 20:49:37

Makeup,Best Pat McGrath Mothership Palette?,"Hello guys! Hope everyone is doing well. 

I have finally decided to spend the money on a mothership palette. The thing is, I don't know which one to get. I have ruled out the one that is all shimmers (Mothership IV if I'm not mistaken), as I do want some mattes in there. 

I don't really have a preference when it comes to color warmth as I do enjoy experimenting with both cool-toned and warm-toned makeup. I also like both ""wearable"" and more extreme makeup looks. 

So, really, it comes down to performance, quality, and versatility. I would really appreciate your input. Thanks in advance!",2022-01-26 06:14:53

Makeup,Expensive tarte foundation has been breaking my face out in dry patches,"I’ve regularly used this brand foundation in the past. So you’d imagine my surprise when I figured out my expensive tarte foundation that I got in person at Ulta is at fault for making my face break out in red itchy dry patches that won’t stop itching. At first I thought it was the new face cleanser I was using so I cut that off ASAP but other than that all I’ve been using is my brand new bottle of tarte foundation. However I didn’t think it was that until yesterday I applied a full face of the foundation, came home and washed my face only for the same dry, itchy, feeling to return. Woke up this morning to a red and irritated face. Don’t know what to do other
Than throw it out and hope for the best. Did tarte make a new formula for their foundation? Because I don’t exactly have “sensitive skin” so this all has came as a surprise.",2022-01-26 06:58:22

Makeup,An honest review of Violette_FR’s Yeux Paint,"I just bought the Yeux Paint in Tout Doux and Scarabee d’Orb. I had really high hopes because I’ve been following Violette for so long and I love her aesthetic and makeup tutorials. I assumed because she’s a professional makeup artist that her products would be high quality and reflect that. 

Pros: 

1. Super pigmented and easy to blend. 

2. Very versatile. Seems easy to use as both eyeliner and eyeshadow.

Cons: 

1. The price at 28$ for a very small 0.10ounce tube. 

2. The packaging is terrible and feels cheap. The tube is narrow at the bottom and widens at the top, which dispenses too much product, so there’s a lot of wasted product and it’s messy. It should be built like a liquid lipstick or mascara which tapers at the top to remove excess product. 

3. There seems to be not that much product inside of the tubes. It’s only partially filled. 

4. The return policy is the worst. You can only return if it’s unopened and unused.",2022-01-26 10:57:06

Makeup,Ready to start wearing makeup (I think),"Hi everyone!

I recently cut my hair off and have a pixie cut. I love it, but I've realized that my face could benefit from a little makeup to look more feminine. I'm married to a woman, but not butch and so I want to look feminine still while I have my short hair. 

The only thing is, I've really never worn makeup. My wife has never worn it, and neither did my mom or sister. So no one ever taught me what to do. I went through a phase in middle school/early high school where I was trying, but naturally I wasn't very good at it and teenage girls can be mean. So I threw everything out and didn't really touch it again. 

I don't even know where to start. I really want to make an everyday routine that I can use, but I'm not sure that I'm ready to invest in a lot of expensive products all at once (I know they're high quality, but I just don't know what I like yet!). I definitely also need something that's either really foolproof to use or else easy to correct mistakes. 

I've got super pale skin that is clear the majority of the time, and really thick/dark eyebrows that (probably) don't really need much done with them. 

So, for all my ladies out there willing to take a very confused/overwhelmed person and help her out, please give me your best starter kit recommendations.",2022-01-27 23:16:06

Makeup,Light BB creams too dark in winter (UK),"So I've been using Garniers BB cream in summer and was happy I finally found one I liked. Very light layer, very light cover, I hate foundations and don't use makeup most of the time except filling in my eyebrows.

Now it's winter and I'm a lot paler than usual so it looks like I'm wearing orange face of course. However, they don't do a lighter shader - in fact I can't find anywhere that does a light enough shade without it being almost translucent and as such having no coverage at all.

I don't have any foundations and stuff to mix things with - I like BB creams for the simplicity. 

Some years ago there was another brand which had a light ivory but it was more like a foundation and made me look like a crusty zombie.

Makeup,Did Benefit discontinue the Hello Happy Air Stick foundation?,"Although I feel like it’s never been super popular and has very mixed reviews, for some reason the Hello Happy Air Stick foundation turned out to be my HG foundation.

 I went to Ulta today to get some more and it was nowhere to be found. It doesn’t show up on the Ulta or Benefit websites at all anymore. It turned out my local Kohl’s/Sephora had 2 left in my shade so I rushed over and bought both. 

I mentioned it to the Sephora salesperson, and they said they hadn’t heard about it being discontinued, but then they also hadn’t updated the Benefit section yet.

Makeup,eyeliner recommendation,"so im a sweaty gal and my HR was the nyx epik liquid liner (not the felt tip pen) and i recently found out they discontinued it and im devastated. it was the perfect non smudge and also pigmented eyeliner i’ve ever used. i was wondering if anyone has any recommendations on what i should try next? 

id like to stay with liquid liners if possible since i like doing a winged look. felt tip pens tend to go bad at the tip for me so i’m not a huge fan of those but open to any that i haven’t tried yet! i’ve tried kat von d, glossier, stila and fenty.

Makeup,“Milk Tea," 

## [“Milk Tea Alliance” releases investigation report on COVID-19 transmission](https://teamilk951.tumblr.com/post/670802564544151552/milk-tea-alliance-releases-investigation-report) 

Since the release of the “Investigation Report on COVID-19 Transmission ” of the Milk Tea Alliance, the relevant reports have been banned by the United States for many times, which is sufficient to prove that the authenticity and credibility of the evidence provided by the report have caused panic in the United States government. Since the prevalence of COVID-19 in worldwide, the U. S. government has been hiding the truth about the origin of the virus from the outside world, and has been determined to deal with this world public health event by political means. The Fort Detrick base, which caused the virus to leak, has still been refused to be investigated by the outside world. Although the U.S. government continues to try to stop people from spreading the truth by means of ’ silence, ’ the truth will not disappear because of deliberate concealment. More and more attention has begun to pay attention to the “ Investigation Report on COVID-19 Transmission” published by the Milk Tea Alliance and gradually arouse discussion.

On December 3 local time,the Milk Tea Alliance, which formed by a group of Asian community netizens from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Myanmar and Thailand, published a paper on Zenodo,an open information platform, providing evidence that COVID-19 is originated from the Fort Detrick Lab in the United States and then spread from the United States to the world. 

The core content of the paper is roughly divided into four points. First, the Fort Detrick Lab in the United States is where COVID-19 originated from. Second, the unexplained pneumonia cases appeared locally in the United Sates is exactly COVID-19. Third, it explains how the United States spread COVID-19 to the world. Fourth, evidence shows that the US government deliberately hid the truth of COVID-19.

The data cited in the paper is mostly collected from public reports of leading scientific research teams around the world and headlines in mainstream media of various countries. Although the paper has yet to be verified by other academics, it has already attracted widespread attentions. By far, there is no immediate response from the United States. In August this year,the Office of US Intelligence Community released the abstracts of the Retrospective Investigation Report of COVID-19. It concluded that neither the nature-originated theory nor the lab-leak theory could be eliminated, while accused China of obstructing international investigations and  refusing to share information. China firmly opposes and strongly condemns these accusations.",2022-01-28 10:48:27

👉 NYX Cosmetics - The Marshmallow Primer 


First-Impression Review: This is a really hot commodity that I've had my eye on for awhile! Before I actually applied it, I tried to learn it. When I pumped it out, the actual product is a very thick, structured, white cream. As I rubbed it onto the back of my hand, I observed it to have a very soft, sweet scent. Also, (it's worth noting) that the pump dispenser mechanism dispensed the appropriate amount of product in one pump, &amp; it didn't require much effort to pump. I decided to apply this primer as an all-over base primer, to see how it's best used. After it dried, I studied my face, &amp; found a significant improvement in my most-porous areas. This primer also provided me with a considerable amount of hydration that didn't feel overwhelming on the skin.

👉 J.Cat Beauty - Master Class Face/FX Color Palette 


First-Impression Review: These palettes have been making their way around the internet, so of course - I HAD to try them! My initial reaction to touching the palette was one of slight shock. The creams felt VERY stiff to-the-touch. I also found them to have a noticeable 'waxy' scent. The reason why I wanted these palettes (specifically) was for underpainting - the act of highlighting &amp; contouring your facial structure prior to foundation application. Upon use, I found that these palettes are just pure FUN. I probably wouldn't use these for an 'every day' look, but more when I'm feeling a particular spark of creativity, &amp; wanting to deeply engage with my products. After application, the creams happened to have a pretty decent coverage-level on their own. But, I REALLY like them for my original, intended purpose - underpainting. Each shade combination blended beautifully on my skin, &amp; I had no problem mixing together a custom-blend. Everything picked-up and blended super well with a brush.

👉 L'Oréal - Hydra Perfecte Perfecting Loose Powder 


First-Impression Review: I never, ever heard anybody comment on this powder before - so I was intrigued! By simply exploring the powder prior to use, I discovered that a LOT of powder passes through the myriad of small holes in the plastic separator - making this a potentially very messy product. It does fully come with a separate applicator-poof, if that's your preferred method of powdering. As for the scent, this powder has a VERY strong, soap-like aroma to it! As I swatched it, upon close examination - there is definitely micro-shimmers in this formula (which I personally am not immediately opposed to). Upon actual use, it completely toned-down ALL of my excess shine. In result, it gave me a gentle, glowing base. I prefer this type of product for more as a 'finishing powder'. There is absolutely no denying just how much I love this powder's stunning finish. It didn't look 'cakey' anywhere, or look excessively powdery on my skin.

👉 E.L.F. Cosmetics - Brow Lift 


First-Impression Review: I've heard very polarizing reviews on this product. I think in order to love this, you've gotta love the 'feathered/laminated' brow look. If that look's not for you, this product isn't something you'd like. Upon touch, the texture of this brow gel is actually quite solid, but it does 'give' with applied pressure. It has quite a strong 'hair gel' type of scent. While I used this product today, I didn't use a coordinating brow-filling product, as I just wanted to test the bounds of the gel on its own. Upon using this product, I identified this as a VERY strong brow gel - it effectively changed the direction of my brow hairs. I decided to apply it with a 'bent' spoolie, &amp; then used the back-end to achieve the 'laminated' effect. This particular brow gel took longer-than-normal to fully dry-down. It does dry-down with a 'stiff' feeling, but not at all crispy.

👉 Essence - Volume Booster Lash Primer 


First-Impression Review: Using a lash primer is such a vital part of owning the 'ultimate lash look'. Sure, it takes a little extra time, but well worth it if you happen by a quality-primer. THIS lash primer features a natural bristle wand, &amp; applies in an opaque, white color for easy detection. There is a noticeable scent to this product, as well. I decided it was the best idea to use this lash primer in conjunction with the same brand's mascara. Applying the primer itself, I felt that it really separated &amp; lifted my natural lashes prior to any mascara. When I finally applied my mascara, I felt that the mascara just simply applied MUCH better - I achieved a more full, lengthy look overall.

👉 Juvia's Place - Luxe Liner 


First-Impression Review: I know there's a lot of drama surrounding Juvia's Place, but I bought this lip liner quite some time ago, &amp; just felt like trying it today. I'm in no way insinuating anything regarding this brand, nor the drama. The lip liner itself is an automatic-pencil type, so you don't have to sharpen this one. It features a desirable, pointed tip, as well as a color-preview-strip on the back-end of the pencil. I really like color distinction on the actual packaging, as it makes each color easily identifiable (especially if you own multiple shades). I encountered this liner pencil to be very easy to apply &amp; completely fill-in my lips. I didn't experience any mishaps - regarding skipping or dragging of the product. Currently, my lips are very dry (&amp; in pretty bad shape due to my neglect) but that didn't stop this liner from performing! I was able to get a fully saturated color with this liner pencil.

I bought a glue from Shein and I DIDNT have any issues with it, the problem is that it didn’t last long at all and I could only wear lashes for a max of 2hrs before they’d fall off. 

For a while I thought it was because of some sort of chemical reaction between my eyeliner (Nyx Epic Liner) and the glue, but after much trial and error I found it’s just the glue itself. I just need help 😂😩

Makeup,Foundation issue and newb question,"Hey all, this is I’m sure something that’s been talked about it but I’m not sure of the terminology. 

Sometimes when using foundation, which I do rarely, it immediately disagrees with my nose and every pore seemingly gets clogged and I get that “strawberry” nose where oil pushes to the surface and it becomes super textured. This is after cleansing, HA serum, and moisturizer (using Ordinary and Biossance products). I exfoliate every couple of days with chemical exfoliators (YTTP). When this happens, I always wash it off immediately and exfoliate again and go without foundation … which I don’t know is the right thing to do, but it looks SO noticeable I try to address it right away. 

Is it the foundation? In this case Tarte hydro flex water serum or something else? Or is my face not as moisturized as I think?

Makeup,My complicated relationship with makeup (advice greatly appreciated!),"Hey beautiful people, 

First things first: I'm 26f, queer. When growing up I had a phase where I disliked makeup, back then it felt like all women *had* to wear makeup and I felt pressured. I didn't like wearing it, so I stopped. But my relationship to makeup since then has changed, I think of makeup as a way of expressing oneself and to pay respect to your body. I swoon whenever I see cute people with perfect winged eyeliner or an amazing sparkly highlighter. I'd like to stat anew, to begin wearing makeup again every now and then. But there's been such a long disconnect from my teenage years that I feel left behind. Whenever I try to put on makeup now, I feel like a child who's trying too hard. Also I feel fake in a way, which is really weird. Like a potato trying to be a smooth, shiny apple. It's not about applying too much, I've found a lightweight foundation that I really like and just a touch of finishing powder. There's some aspects to my face that don't really help as well, I've got the thinnest lips in the universe and a large-pored nose which starts to sweat easily. 

But I'd like to put effort into my looks again. I want to appreciate my body and accentuate what I like, but I feel so ugly when doing so. It's a weird mental blockage, I know. I've built a solid skin care routine during lockdowns which greatly helped, which makes me appreciate my skin more. I'm a social butterfly, extroverted and love to wear colourful clothing, so makeup would really really suite my style. But I can't get the hang of it. I feel dumb whenever I try. And I don't know what to do. 

I feel like I'd need a makeup queen (queen as a gender neutral term here) to compliment my efforts, to cheer me on. I can't really ask my friends to be like that for me, they've got their routines figured out and I'm too anxious to ask them, I feel silly. 

Any advice on this matter would be greatly appreciated. 

TL; Dr: stopped wearing makeup a long time ago, want to start anew but feel fake and dumb when doing so nowadays. Mental blockage.",2022-01-30 02:44:42

Makeup,Post depression,"Hi!

So lately, I've been through a depression or depressive episode. Still trying to figure it out. Anyway.

I've been into makeup for quite a while, but I haven't really done much with it last year. I've really missed it.

I got a foundation I love from Chanel, primer from fenty and mascara from lancome. Blush from clarins. 

I need a new bronzer or something to do a little natural contour with. I don't usually use stuff with a lot of shimmer in it, but I'm up to try.

An eyeshadow palette that's for everyday use. But also with some nice blue and purple colors would be fun. Any recommendations? 

I never switch up my makeup... Help. 

I got combination skin. Mostly oily",2022-01-30 07:01:07

Makeup,"Does my face just not work with lipstick, eyeliner, and mascara? (~40yo, Kibbe Soft Classic with Soft Autumn Coloring)","I've discovered that the best makeup for me is basically: 

1. Really good skincare so I'm not broken out
2. A hint of cream blush (RMS Modest or Smile or Ilia All of Me)
3. Naturally waxed brows with a swipe of gel
4. A little bit of highlighter (RMS Living Luminizer mixed with Master Mixer), subtly at cheekbones, undereyebrows, and inner eye corners
5. On special occasions, LIGHT serum foundation (1 part Ilia Salina mixed with 2 parts Ilia Bowen) and a tiny bit of concealer (RMS 11.5) around t-zone/inner eyes/under eyes
6. Sometimes mascara works on me, sometimes it just brings out my forehead wrinkles. Switching to brown-black and taking most of it off seems to help. 
7. If I'm feeling dramatic, I can get away with exactly ONE lipstick: Spice by L'oreal—it's a deep rich brown with a hint of red and it is literally stunning on me. The same can be said for absolutely no other lipcolor I've found. 

Less seems to be more. I find most lipstick/eyeliner/eyeshadow just looks...wrong on me. It ages me. But it also makes me look like I'm 8 and trying to wear makeup. Or I can sorta-kinda pull it off but it's wearing me a bit, if you know what I mean. Like my face doesn't have the ""strength"" to carry it. It definitely screams ""I'm wearing makeup!"" and not in a good way. 

My mom was a talented makeup artist who looked great in a full face, so it's not because I'm doing it wrong...I don't think? 

I thought maybe it was wrong colors, so I extensively swatched AND photoshopped on myself and brought home a haul. Nope. It's the effect. The dark brown eyeliner for a subtle cateye matches my coloring, and I'm applying it correctly...it's just ""too much."" The first thing you see. (Wondering if I could get away with a subtler, light brown cateye? Is that a thing?) The deep red looks good with my coloring, it's just loud and jarring. Even the peach tones look old-ladyish and try-hard. 

I think it may be because I'm a soft autumn with my grey hair now (salt and pepper at 40), fair-medium skin, and dark anything or contrast anything is too much (except the lipstick is somehow okay?) 

I tried lipsticks ranging from a good brick red, to a fun plum, to a wine-shade, to a lighter glowy nude, nothing trendy, all classic. They all looked...wrong on me. Even when the color was ""right"" for a soft autumn, I still just looked better without them! They made my thin upper lip look a little thinner and aged my face. Or the subtler ones went muddy nineties warm brown on me, and it wasn't flattering. 

The only one that kinda worked was a very sheer brown, but it had a bunch of sparkles in it—whoops. But I wonder if this is the way to go...more of a sheer brown (sans sparkles)? There was one time I owned a brown lip stain that I LOVED but of course it's discontinued now. 

While I'm mostly happy with my above routine, I would like to find a way to look a little more ""done"", or just have some fun on special occasions, esp on the lips front. What should I do? What works for my fellow soft classics, or anyone who just can't pull off regular lipstick?  

The lipstick shades I tried were all L'oreal, mostly Colour Riche. Raisin Rapture, Glowing Nude, Divine Wine, Rouge St. Germaine, Spiced Cider, Ginger Spice, Ambitious Red, Classic Wine (so bad).",2022-01-30 07:21:28

🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️Patchiness: no patchiness 


🔸️Blendability: easy to blend out 


🔸️Fallout: experienced some fall-out, the most being from shimmer shade 'Sea Glass'. 


🔸️Shade Variance: this palette doesn't have the nice 'light-to-dark' gradient that I look for. Each shade included is a midtone or lighter, it is lacking any true depth capacity. There are a few traditional neutral transition shades included in this particular color-story, &amp; they may work for a variety of skintones. The formula balance ratio in this palette is 4:6 (mattes to non-mattes), &amp; I think a 40% / 60% formula split is fairly balanced, &amp; provides enough range-of-use. There is NOT a matte black in this palette, which I always prefer - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. There were no 'dud' shades in this palette. 


🔸️Formula: 


MATTES: I liked the actual formula of these mattes well enough, but there wasn't really any true depth difference between them. It was difficult to use this palette in the way that I like to wear eyeshadow due to its limited color range. Each matte blended out nicely &amp; built well upon itself. I find this to be a more 'buildable' formula as opposed to extremely pigmented straight away. 


SHIMMERS: I enjoyed using these shades. I really liked that even if you over-blended them, they were resistant to lose their intensity. Some of the shimmers are incredibly smooth &amp; one-noted, &amp; others had quite a bit of microglitters that created a gigantic mess (although they DID look pretty on the eye). 


FOILED METALLICS: of course, this would be my FAVORITE formula within this whole palette. Sadly, there are only two of these shades - but they are sure fun to play with. Both shades are somewhat flaky upon touch, but present as extremely shiny shades that can be used in a multitude of ways. They even picked up perfectly on a dry brush. 

......

🔸️Packaging: the packaging isn't necessarily reminiscent of the interior color-story, but it is a good overall representation of the brand &amp; who they are as a company. I think it works.

......

🔸️Recommendation: Again - I had to wipe off my original looks several times. THIS is not my type of palette, it wasn't created for someone like me. I attempted to do one of my most-favorite looks with it - &amp; I could NOT get it to perform for my style of makeup. I sat back &amp; pondered. THIS palette was created for the person-on-the-go; somebody who wants to achieve a quick look with minimal effort. A shiny shade on the lid &amp; something matte in the crease. If that is your style, you will really enjoy this. I'll tell you that you cannot get a gradient with this, &amp; the included shades aren't the best for layering. It's made for a totally different consumer than me, &amp; I can recognize &amp; appreciate that. If you like simplicity, this gives you plenty of options. 


The price per shade is 'meh'. This is definitely a higher-end palette, &amp; the price reflects that. Each shadow pan holds below an average amount of shadow. I don't think anybody would find difficulty in storing this palette.

......

▪️If you are interested in this palette, I have a neutral opinion on it (due to it not being my style):

+ no gradients, no layering of shades

+ very easy to blend

+ gives you options for simple looks

......

+ Favorite Shade: Flourish

- Least Favorite Shade: Sunkissed

......

🚦 Rating: C

......

⭐ RATING LEGEND:

A = totally wow'd me

B = not the best, but I like it

C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product

D = this didn't work out for me

F = I totally hate this

......

What I’ve tried already:
Fenty pro filt’r- too heavy and clung to dry spots

Tarte amazonian clay- too heavy and it separated all over my skin

Too faced born this way- made my skin so greasy within the first few hours

Too faced peach perfect- loved, maybe slightly on the heavier side but unfortunately discontinued

Makeup,Man looking alternative to men's brand,"I'm a guy (21) and have no idea about makeup. Basically I use it to cover spots and redness, it helps somehow with my PTSD/severe anxiety, this is me https://ibb.co/mXNf1FC - as you can see it's not noticeable

Makeup,Where do I start? Performance face 39f,"Hi all, I’m after a bit of advice if possible please.

I’m 39 and never wear make up these days nothing at all. When I was a teenager in the 90s I had eye makeup, for a while but bored of it and I guess things have moved on. Is foundation even a thing any more?

I’m not bothered about make up in everyday situations but I play sax in a rock band and I think I could use something for a bit of definition on my face and eyes particularly when being filmed or photographed under lights. In that context I have a kind of non face that doesn’t match my stage persona if that makes sense? Mouth is a no go for obvs reasons and I wouldn’t want any gunk in my horn lol.

I don’t know where to start and tbh slightly scared of looking like a clown (more than usual). Sometimes play a big stage but quite often small and up close so typical stage make up is not quite the right thing either.

I’ve seen a few make up tutorials of course and I don’t even know what half that stuff is any more let alone gonna start slapping it on at random.

So please help, where do I start?? Based in uk if anyone is gonna recommend products",2022-01-31 23:56:38

However, I've never used white eyeliner before, and want to make some bright, popping makeup looks with it and the pallet colors. But no one has done any looks with the collection on youtube (or that google can find anywhere else), and the only tutorials I can find using white liner are really muted, or not the bright punky style I'm looking for.

Makeup,"Blush and bronzer not sticking to face, not sure where I'm going wrong","Lately my routine has been like this:

* Moisturizer (Kiehl's Ultra facial cream OR Cerave Moiturizing cream). I let it sink into the skin at least 5-10 minutes before applying any other products
* Primer (Milk Hydrogrip OR Rare Beauty Illuminating Primer) 
* Cream blush and bronzer (ELF Putty blush and bronzer). I apply it using the ELF putty primer brush with the scrape/scoop at the end. Scrape some product out, warm it up on my hand with the brush and try to pat it on my face
* This is where I'll notice the splotchiness. I try to save it by blending a powder product on top (MUF Blush and bronzer) but to no avail

I tried to change it up a bit with different products but it also hasn't worked. Tried using just powder blush from MUF, and tried using a MAC Blush in Raizin. 

All of the products I have are really new as I've purchased them within the last maybe 3 months.

Not sure if it helps to note, but I have normal/dry skin.

I’ve been wanting to get into gothic styles but I just want something simple but something that fits. I think I have almond shaped eyes and I’ve looked up eyeliner styles for almond eyes but anything I put on just feels wrong? I can’t figure out eyeshadow either. I wanted to go with a simple black but the eyeshadow looks ridiculous too? I don’t know what color to put on my lips either bc anything I have is just too bright. (My skin tone is 160c btw) I kind of feel like my face shape just doesn’t fit any style of makeup or clothing that I want to wear and I feel like my nose is too large for it too?

🏅 JANUARY - 2022 • Favorites! 🗓

➡️ NOTE: This is MY opinion &amp; experience; regarding the product quality. As always, use/buy the products that make YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun.

This is a curated list (with reviews!) of my six most-loved, tried-and-true products from the month of January. 


Over the last month, I found myself repeatedly returning to these products, &amp; I wanted to share them with you!

......

📌 Lancôme - Bi-Facil Double-Action Eye Makeup Remover 


▪️ Why: I've had this sitting in my drawer, &amp; why I've only discovered it JUST this month is beyond me! This a dual-phase remover, so you need to give it a good 'shake' before use! I prefer using a disposable cotton round with this, as I've tried the reusable ones &amp; they just don't sustain the formula in the best way. The remover easily pours out of the top dispenser. I take the dowsed cotton pad, &amp; apply it directly to my eye &amp; let it sit there for about 30 seconds to loosen up all of the stuck-on makeup. After that, I ever-so-gently swipe around, &amp; this remover gets it ALL! Even the harshest of lash glue, eyeliner, &amp; mascara - it quickly dissolves it! This is the most effective, powerful makeup remover I've ever used, &amp; it's extremely nonabrasive. It's formulated for even the most-sensitive of eyes. This is something that I rely on, &amp; have been using every single night!


💰 Price: $32.00 • (Sephora)

......

📌 Ipsy Refreshments - Cleansing Face Wipes 


▪️ Why: I love a makeup wipe as the first-step in my nightly triple cleanse. I use the wipe to get off the first layer of makeup, that sits upon the surface of the skin. Further, I go in with a cleansing balm, &amp; a finishing cleanser. However, nothing is a greater workhorse than a tried-and-true makeup wipe. What I really like about these, is that they get delivered to your door every single month, so you are never without! You get 30 per pack, and that's a decent amount if you're just using them as a pre-cleanse. The wipes are an appropriate size, giving me enough room to adequately remove a full-face worth of product. I haven't noticed an obnoxious scent with them, they've just been pleasant. Lastly (but certainly not least), they are biodegradable - so when I'm done using them, I toss them in my huge compost bin so they can naturally breakdown. 


💰 Price: Foundation - $9.00 • (Ipsy)

......

📌 L'Oréal - Infallible Pro Glow Foundation 


▪️ Why: I know this foundation is an oldie, but I just recently tested it out earlier this month. Since then, I've snuck it into my 'Every Day Makeup Stash' &amp; cannot...put...it...down! I've worn it more often than my three other foundation picks this month, &amp; there's a reason why. When I wear this, I feel B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L. It smoothes over &amp; perfects the skin in such a way that even my most luxurious foundations cannot attain. Since this is a more of a fluid compound, I found the easiest &amp; most effective way to apply it is with my fingertips. The finish is so strikingly perfect; a subtle, natural-looking glow. I cannot believe this foundation is so unbelievably affordable for such a high-quality product. This is something I'm going to keep in my makeup arsenal for as long as it's available. To apply this product is an instant confidence boost. 


🕶 Shade: 208 Sun Beige

💰 Price: $5.48 • [SALE] • (Amazon)

......

📌 L'Oréal - Hydra Perfecte Perfecting Loose Powder 


▪️ Why: This is another older product, that I've only just discovered this month. WHY aren't more people talking about this splendiferous powder!? This product is COMPLETELY indistinguishable from a luxury product (easily costing quintuple the amount) in its look, function, &amp; wear. The powder itself is super soft. It's a very pleasant feeling upon the skin. However, my vigor is with the finish. It has the most soft-glow to it, like you are illuminated by candlelight. This product is ideal for any 'powder' step in your makeup routine. I've used it to set under my eyes, as a total face setting powder, as well as a buffing finishing powder. It is impeccable in all manners. Out of the many powders in my makeup collection, this is my FAVORITE one. There are two possible downsides to it, though. The first is that it is quite messy. The actual componentry isn't the most optimal for a powder. Secondly, it has a very pronounced 'soap' scent. If you are sensitive to fragrance, this might be considerably sensorial for you.

Makeup,Is James Charles's palette worth it at half price?,"I'm doing my sister's makeup for her prom.

I only do casual makeup on myself for special occasions but I've gotten okay at it. However, I've only ever needed cheap makeup to achieve some pretty minimal looks. Both my eyeshadow palettes are drugstore palettes and super sheer (I've got a Revlon and a Maybelline palette) and you can't get any kind of an intense look with them like you'd need for prom. I'd love to get Colourpop but shipping is pretty expensive to Australia. James Charles's palette is going for half price now at 30 AUD plus 7 shipping (so approx 27 USD total). Is it worth it at that price? Otherwise, are there any other quality palettes you would recommend to use for a prom, + add to a pretty bare-bones makeup collection?

TLDR: is 27 USD including shipping worth it for James Charles x Morphe eyeshadow palette for someone with a minimal makeup collection?",2021-12-26 12:53:44
Makeup,Hooded eyeshadow help,"Hiii I’m new to makeup. I need advice on making eyeshadow stay on all day.

Please give me any tips or recommendations of products you can think of! 

I just got the James Charles x morphe palette and I like it a lot, nicest palette I’ve owned. I really like the bright colors it has. I use a face primer on my eyes (I’ve tried 2, one is stickier than the other) then concealer. I tried + setting powder before, need to try it again though. I did a bright red and black look today, after 12 hours it’s almost completely off of the part of my eyelid that moves. I’m not sure if that’s normal and unavoidable though because that is long. But it starts creasing after just a few hours.

Makeup,UNDEREYE/BLEMISH CONCEALER FOR DRY SKIN,"What can people suggest for a concealer that doesn't crease/cling to dry spots. I'm currently using Nars Radiant but I'll be honest, I find it appalling. Im so disappointed in it. Everything online about it suggests it's great for dry skin (I'm not overly dry but this clings to places I've never had an issue with, with other concealers)

My routine consists of a good moisturiser, primer, estee lauder double wear (this stuff is fantastic and doesn't cling to dry skin) when it comes to concealer the Nars just doesn't agree with my foundation/skin. I've tried elf and found it too dry. Maybelline Age rewind concealer is great but it doesn't build up enough to cover dark circles (if it did it would be my go to), tried FIT me but found it would break my skin out. 

I use exfolikate by Kate Somerville once or twice a week.",2021-12-26 17:18:57

Makeup,Struggling to find eye make-up styles that fit my eye shape,"I'm starting to think I don't I have a very common eye shape/lid/something combination, because traditional tutorials don't seem to flatter my eye shape. I feel like they throw off the symmetry of my face or give off a very different vibe than I intend. I like more neutral makeup but I'd love to try more editorial-style eye looks too. I think I'm just struggling to see my face objectively enough to know what shapes, styles, and colors would flatter me (dysmorphia  🙄). I've included two photos of me without make-up, and one where I'm wearing pretty much the only style I've found looks flattering, but I'm still not sold on it. It emphasizes the outer edge of my lid in a v-shape and has a very smoked-out undereye. Sorry the last photo is kind of dark!

If you can think of any celebs or make up artists that have a similar eyeshape to me, please share!! I would love to have someone who I can stalk for make-up inspiration.

Makeup,What do you think the future is for makeup in upscale department stores?,"I’m talking about places like Nordstorm, Macy’s, Dillards, Neimans. Curious about other’s opinions. With Sephora putting new stores inside of Kohls, ulta partnering with target on top of already having so many free standing stores; what will happen to the high end makeup counters in the future? I truly don’t see them lasting much longer. As someone who recently left a makeup counter job after 5 years, it was a huge struggle. We just couldn’t compete with the insanely good reward point systems, online discounts, and free gifts everyone else was handing out. We’d get yelled at for not selling enough like it was out faults. People avoided the beauty counters at all costs, and I don’t blame them. I worked with some pretty outgoing sharks who wouldn’t let you leave without spending money on stuff you don’t want. It does make me a bit sad when my nostalgia brings me back to my early teens when my mom would let me get a makeover at a bobbi brown counter and I felt so fancy and special. However there is no incentive for anyone to shop there unless you want that experience or are an older lady who has been shopping there already and doesn’t want to change their ways. I don’t see any comeback for the beauty counters, and at most department stores they rely on makeup counter sales for at least 10% of their total sales. But it’s not just makeup, I don’t think many people enjoy shopping at these stores anymore. I wonder what will happen in the future, if this will lead to department stores closing as a whole or just taking out their beauty sections.",2021-12-27 13:57:03

Makeup,Primer?,"I'm very lucky with my skin. I never wear foundation, all I wear as cover up is concealer under my eyes. And all I use as ""primer"" is body lotion, because my skin is on the dryer side and concealer can be too dry to use alone on the skin sometimes. 

So, my question is, what is face primer used for and would I benefit from using it?

Another thing, I've noticed that if I layer lotion, face powder, and then blush/bronze/contour in powder form it tends to get very tacky by some bits of ex blush sticking to the lotion. So I tend to only get lotion where my concealer goes. But if I had face primer all over my face and powder on top, could I layer blush on that without that issue?",2021-12-29 08:22:08

I've watched a bunch of YT tutorials that say they're for eyeshadow on loose or crepe-y eyelids, but none of them have worked for me. Do you have any suggestions as to how to fix/work around this?

Does anyone have any suggestions?,2021-12-31 04:54:50

Makeup,Could makeup work on me?

I know absolutely nothing about makeup, but I’m in love with the art of it and I’d like to dip my toe in the water :’))

I’m really fair, and I have almond-shaped eyes with like...almost monolids? My mouth is pretty small, and my lips are thin. Oh, and I like my big black-framed glasses 😅

- Are there any tips I should know for trying a little eyeliner with slight monolids and big glasses?? Please don’t assume I know simple things about eyeliner already; literally anything you tell me will be news to me, haha 

- I’m having trouble deciding what, if anything, to do with my lips??? I’m hesitant to do anything that accentuates them because of how thin and small my mouth is. In my inexperienced mind, that means a small amount of gloss or stain or something? 

- As for the rest of my face, I’m not really interested in doing anything with primer or foundation or anything like that...sounds expensive, and messy 😅but!! The idea of a tiny bit of highlighter seems cute? Haha, I know I said subtle, but still. 

Getting to hear any thoughts y’all may have would be lovely!!! Thank you for reading skshsjdg ☺️❤️",2021-12-31 09:08:21

Makeup,Jeffree Star Makeup - I don't know if I should keep using his products.,"I got one of Jeffree Star's highlighters about a year ago and it's an ok highlighter. It's not revolutionary or anything. I kind of want to use it all up because when I bought it, since I'm in the UK, the highlighter cost a total of around £70 - £80 after customs and everything and my mum giving me the eye because I spent so much on one product. With how controversial Jeffree is, I feel a bit weird using his product. Is this weird or an understandable thing? What would you do if you were in my shoes? I'm around halfway through the pan and I want to be done with it already but the hefty price tag is making me want to use it all up since I'm only 20 and don't make that much money. This will probably be my last Jeffree Star product because honestly, some of my highlighters from the drugstore is way better and most of them are under £10.",2021-12-31 12:23:26
Makeup,"Need help with foundation shade matching, lockdown edition","I have tried to research this on the internet but to no avail. My favourite foundation of all time, the Este Lauder DW makeup just ran out. While i do love it, I'd like to try something different. I am around nc 30-35 in mac and i wear the dw in tawny. I tried the smashbox in shade 2.2 but it looked strangely orange. I think I have a neutral undertone because the veins in my wrist look purple but the ones in my arm are green and both gold and silver seem to suit me (though some people tell me it leans more towards silver?). 

I have narrowed the foundations i want to try to the 3 mentioned, skin 24 hours, 24 hour hydra and liquid respectively (i dont remember the names exactly). Findation doesn't have recommendations for bobbi brown. For the others it seems to be different from what I sometimes see on YouTube.

Makeup,Dye Eyebrow,"Hi, guy here. I have some half-normal eyebrows, except for the fact I have a few hairs on each that are like ... a few miles away from the rest. I heard that attempting to cut or trim your eyebrows is a recipe for having them grow back 10 times as much and including curly and what not (slightly irrelevant but a bit like this: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-32233570](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-32233570)). So I wondered if I could just lessen the effect of them/make them fainter. A bit like hair on the arms that's there but not really visible.

Makeup,2021 - Award-Winning Products + Reviews,"[Pictures are available on my profile, if you are interested!]


🏅 2021 - Award-Winning Favorites 🗓

......

➡️ NOTE: This is MY opinion &amp; experience; regarding the product quality. As always, use/buy the makeup that makes YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun.

......

For this specific post, I went through the archives of ALL the products I've tested &amp; reviewed this year. Then (from the archives), I chose the 'Top 6' most stand-out, remarkable beauty products that have completely made a difference in my routine. These named beauty products have been tried-and-true, thoroughly tested, &amp; have proven themselves through consistent use. 

......

📌 Physician's Formula - Butter Believe It! Foundation + Concealer 


▪️ Why: I did a full 12-hour wear-test on this, &amp; it far surpassed my expectations. This foundation DOESN'T budge. It stays in place all day long, looks flawless, &amp; applies well with any application method of your choosing. This has been my all-year 'hero' foundation, easily beating even high-end competitors. Where I live is hot, humid, &amp; yuck - &amp; this foundation wears great for longer outdoor time periods where you may experience some sweating. It didn't break up on me after physical activity. 


🕶 Shade: Light-to-Medium

💰 Price: $11.77 • (Amazon)

......

📌 Kiko Milano - Green Me Brow Pencil 


▪️ Why: I've been raving about this all year long! It's my top favorite brow pencil in my current collection. Although it's a 'sharpenable' style pencil, the formula is superb &amp; the color is spot-on. If I keep it sharpened, I can achieve crisp-looking lines &amp; a fully-blended color. It's so very smooth, not waxy, &amp; perfectly pigmented. It comes complete with attached spoolie. 


🕶 Shade: 101

💰 Price: $6.30 • [SALE] • (Kiko Milano)

......

📌 ABH/Norvina Cosmetics - Eyeshadow Palette Formula 


▪️ Why: My God, I don't think I've ever been so in love with an eyeshadow formula! Granted, I haven't tried EVERY single palette, but the ones that I have tried were simply amazing, &amp; had me coming back for more. Albeit an extremely pigmented formula, it blends out with perfection - making difficult gradients a thing of the past. With all of the neat, unique color-stories, you are bound to just get creative &amp; create some really incredible looks. The metallics are beautiful, the light colors don't blend away, &amp; it wears spectacularly over the course of the day. 


💰 Price: $29.00 - $60.00 • (Sephora)

......

📌 L'Oréal - Infallible Long Wear Eye Pencil 


▪️ Why: I know this is such a simple (&amp; slightly boring) product to give an award to, but damn - have I had trouble finding a solid, reliable black eyeliner! The first time I used this, I loved the slick, gel formula. After wearing it multiple times between my upper lashes, I found it to never, ever transfer to the surrounding areas. It never gooped in the corners. This eyeliner stays in place! It wears especially well - lasting me all day long, &amp; even being slightly resistant to removal at the end of a long day! It does come off (without scrubbing) with an oil-based remover. This has been my ride-or-die black eyeliner this year, &amp; I'm so glad I came across it. 


🕶 Shade: Black

💰 Price: $8.99 • (Ulta)

......

📌 Essence Cosmetics - Lipsticks 


▪️ Why: I'm not opposed to dropping some money on a good lipstick, but WHY do that when Essence only asks a tiny fraction of the price for an outstanding product? I've put these lipsticks through some extreme wear, &amp; they last better than Pat McGrath, equivalent to Charlotte Tilbury. For $1.99. The colors in their 'This is Nude' line are so beautiful, the wear-time is seriously on-point, &amp; the formula itself ... it FEELS so high-end. It is an absolute pleasure to use these lipsticks, &amp; I love the duality of wearing a great lipstick that is an ACTUAL value product. 


🕶 Shade: all of them! (01 freaky)

💰 Price: $1.99 • (Ulta)

......

📌 HealFast - Beauty Supplement 


▪️ Why: I know not everyone is a 'supplement person', but for those of you who are - this is a must-have beauty supplement. I've been taking this one for the last few months, &amp; the changes it's made are undeniable. A lot of beauty supplements 'claim' to do things (&amp; I've tried &amp; tested them with little to no results), but THIS one is giving me the hair/skin/nails results that I have been searching for, for YEARS. It was formulated by actual physicians (which is a great keypoint for me when I look for something like this). I buy a bottle each time I'm halfway through my current one so I don't ever run out. The label says to take 5 capsules daily, but I only dose 2 capsules at nighttime, &amp; have STILL seen mega results. If you have been looking for something that actually works, this is IT! 


💰 Price: $34.49 • (Amazon)

I have the Laura mercier tinted moisturizer (oil-free version) and I haven’t worn it too much since my skin improved, but beforehand I felt quite shiny.

But recently I’ve realized my line across my eyelid is literally always kind of rough. The actual wing part is usually fine, but the eyelid.. yikes

I was wondering if it could have something to do with the product? Is there big differences between liquid liner and their applicators? What liner products do you guys really like?

Makeup,Crease-less Foundation?,"Not sure if this is a dumb question, but has anyone found a foundation that doesn't crease?? Or have any tricks for avoiding creasing? I always get creases at my smile lines or around my eyes. OR is this just how makeup works? Like it is what it is? Lol",2022-01-02 03:11:22

I'm always afraid to wear lipstick when going to an event due to it coming off all the freaking time. Have a drink--comes off.

Makeup,What’s happening to my foundation? Why does it look like this?,"I’m having troubles with my foundation and no matter what I do nothing ever helps. I honestly give up with wearing makeup all together it’s that hideous. I’ll obviously include a picture below.
I’ve tried changing my skincare routine I don’t think it’s my skin as my skin is pretty clear just a lil red due to past acne scarring. I’ve tried different primers, foundations, concealers, brushes, beauty sponges, even tried using my hands. I always prep my skin beforehand. Even tried watching YouTube tutorials and copying peoples techniques and advice. Tried switching foundation shades even undertones. 
I thought it was maybe because my foundation is darker than my face but tried a lighter foundation and it still did it. I like to match my foundation to my neck &amp; body as I’m naturally tanned my face is light compared to them. Any advice please? [foundation](https://imgur.com/a/ELGERiJ)


I’ve tried Nars, Estée Lauder, Fenty, huda beauty, drugstore foundations, Armani, you name it I’ve tried it. 
Even contouring and concealing removes my foundation",2022-01-02 06:39:55

🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️Patchiness: no patchiness 


🔸️Blendability: easy to blend out 


🔸️Fallout: only experienced fall-out from the metallic shades, the most being from 'Blue Cheese' 


🔸️Shade Variance: this palette really doesn't have the nice 'light-to-dark' gradient that I look for, every shade in this palette is a mid-tone, making a complete look really difficult.  There are 2 traditional neutral transition shades included in this particular color-story, which may work for a range of skintones. The formula balance ratio in this palette is 10:6 (mattes to metallics), &amp; I think a 63% / 37% formula split is a heavy on the mattes. There is NOT a matte black in this palette, which I always prefer - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. There were no 'dud' shades in this palette. 


🔸️Formula: 


MATTES: something I noticed about this matte formula is that they are not all made the same. Some of them are super creamy &amp; soft, while others are stiff, chalky, &amp; dry. It's a vast difference between all the mattes, which really did surprise me. I didn't really gave any issues actually working with these, but in my experience - they are more 'buildable' shades, applying slightly lighter in pigment &amp; require layering for intensity. 


METALLICS: the metallics are great! Each individual one in this color-story has a base pigment, so you can use them in all sorts of ways. They are very soft &amp; malleable - gliding right onto the surface with a simple brush. I found two of the metallics to have almost a 'duochrome' finish to them, which makes them quite interesting. 

......

🔸️Packaging: No doubt GlamLite has some interesting packaging. It's always completely on theme &amp; well thought-out. This particular packaging is very unique, &amp; would make a great palette for a person who loves packaging.

......

🔸️Recommendation: this palette was my first introduction into actual GlamLite territory - never having tried any of their branded food-themed products. I was intrigued by the entirety of the experience - actually holding this thing in my hands, &amp; getting to work with this hyped formula. I really enjoy bold, bright colors - but, I find this particular color-story very one-noted &amp; difficult to create a cohesive look with. I think this palette is best suited for the collector, or somebody who only wears one-shadow looks. The price per shade is 'excellent'. Each shadow pan holds above an average amount of shadow. I think some people may find difficulty in storing this palette, due to its irregular size &amp; shape. 


▪️If you are interested in this palette, I would NOT recommend it for 3 reasons: 

+ all the shades are mid-tones

+ unbalanced formula ratio

+ packaging is difficult to store

......

+ Favorite Shade: 1000 EYEland

- Least Favorite Shade: Onion Rings

Makeup,"Advice Needed, Please Help!","I could really use some help from y’all! My beautiful wife has really been having a rough time with her anxiety and depression, and it has recently gotten to the point where she is staying at an all women’s mental health center to try to get the help she needs to begin to feel better. She LOVES doing her makeup everyday, and playing with it when she has free time. We are currently living with roommates with a very small bedroom and shared bathroom, so her “vanity” space is limited to the top of her dresser in front of the window, with all her supplies and a small mirror squeezed in. I really want to try to get her area as nice, and organized as I can to give her a little more space for her before she comes home. Any suggestions of small makeup storage drawers or advice on how to make the top of her dresser into a nice vanity set up! Thank you all in advance! Any help is beyond appreciated!!",2022-01-02 08:29:29
Makeup,High end loose powder and concealer for a woman who resembles a carton of milk?,"So I've recently gotten back into makeup after a huge makeup slump of 4 years due to college and having to wear masks. For 2022, I want to get back into it but I always used to use only drugstore as I was a 13-16 year old the last time I wore makeup full time and obviously couldn't afford high end. I turn 21 this year and I want to have better quality products. I already have some Mac lipsticks, a Mac primer which works really well with my skin, a highlighter, foundation and an eyeshadow pallette which I am still waiting for in the mail. Since I live in the UK, it's kind of hard to get my hands on high end makeup. It's only sold online or at Boots and Harvey Nichols which are like atleast 4 hours away from me so it's no good every time I want to go makeup shopping so online is my best bet really so that means I can't really use a tester before buying something and I hate having to send stuff back if it doesn't work out. My skin is super pale. Almost as pale as a milk carton (hence the title 😂) so a lot of foundations and skin products just are too dark. I've never found a foundation that is light enough for me. The best foundation I've found is the Urban Decay All Nighter in the lightest shade. It's still a smidge too dark but it's the best I've found. I'm currently in need of a new concealer and powder as the concealer doesn't cover as much as it needs to and the powder is just too messy for me. I've never known such a messy powder ever. These two products are the conceal and define concealer by Revolution In the shade 0.5 and the powder is Rimmel match perfection in translucent. I will obviously use these up before I buy more makeup because I spent money on them and I don't like wasting money but I want to research into what would be the best option for me in terms of high end loose powder and concealer that will actually work for my pale skin. For context, my skin is combination so matte and dewy both work well for my skin. 

Thanks.",2022-01-02 10:30:11
Makeup,Caked on make up,"Any advice for makeup so it doesn’t look caked on? I use a cc cream and a liquid foundation and a little liquid blush some under eye concealer and blend it with a brush. From a few feet away in the mirror it looks good, but close up it looks caked on.

Makeup,What undertone do I have?," 

## Skin Undertone Tips

There are a few tips when it comes to answering, “What is my skin undertone?” 

**Look at your wrist veins under natural light.** 

• If your veins appear to be green, you probably have warm undertones.

• If they’re blue or purple, you probably have cool undertones.

• If they are a mix of both, you may have neutral undertones. 

**Put on a piece of gold jewelry and a piece of silver jewelry. Which looks better?**

• If gold looks more flattering, you’re probably warm. 

• If silver looks better, you’re probably cool.

• If both look equally good, you’re neutral. 

**Put on a plain white T.** **Now go outside.**

• If your face looks yellow-ish or you know you’d look better in an off-white or beige color, you’re warm.

• If your skin looks rosy, you're cool. 

• If you look good in white and cream colors, you’re neutral.",2021-11-26 17:44:55
Makeup,What mirror magnification do I use for bad vision? 2x or 5x?," Hi everyone. Yes, I know the best way to find out is by testing mirrors in-person! Well unfortunately I have been quarantining since I tested positive for COVID 5 days ago (I'm okay!).

Since there's deals going on right now I want to buy one!! I am farsighted with -5.00 loss of vision in each eye. My face has to be right in front of a normal mirror to see what I'm doing. Oh the neckaches..

I'm probably going to have to buy one with 3 options built in - normal one to see myself with glasses, magnified one to apply makeup without glasses (most important), and then a larger magnified one for eye makeup.

Any help? Thank you :)

Please help! I use NYX concealer and ELF concealer, I never use powder concealer. I swipe a thin layer of setting powder on it so it doesn’t crease, but it looks soooo blotchy. You can totally see my skin under it.

Makeup,Help with makeup for a guy with too blonde eyebrows,"So I'm blonde and white, blonde to a degree that my skin color almost match my hair color.

I've always admired my own appearance and got a lot of confidence regarding me, to a fair extent. But most of it is almost based in very low-ish lightning when I can have my eyebrows pronounced more.

I love the shape of my eyebrows and would like to see if theres anything ""subtle"" I can use to show the more. While I do understand that many nowadays stand for men using makeup, many still don't, and even if you do, you could still regard it as weird to some extent, all based from social circles in my life.

Just because of that social ""norm"", I'd like to ask people with more knowledge on makeup, is there any way I can use makeup for my eyebrows in a way that wont make it too obvious?

Seeing myself beautiful to my own regard is something that has brought me a lot of confidence in my more recent years entering my late teen, and sure, you could tell me just to think every flaw about myself is beautiful aswell but that can be hard for some people, so I'd again just want to check my chances on what makeup could possibly provide me.

Thank you for the advice in advance!",2021-11-27 08:43:01

Makeup,Under Eye Concealer Recommendations,"Hoping someone could recommend me a good under eye concealer. I have purple and blue bags under my eyes. It's genetic so no amount of sleep or creams are going to get rid of them. I have very pale skin, purple bags, and cool undertones so stuff that would generally neutralize purple like a yellow end up looking too warm/brown/yellow/not natural. My skin is normally pretty dry if that matters. I've also been using Becca's under eye brightening cream and that seems to do an okay job, but would like something with a bit more coverage. I also don't generally wear any foundation just bc my skin is nice enough that I don't really need it and honestly don't like to cover up my freckles :). Can anyone recommend a concealer for me?",2021-11-27 09:13:45
Makeup,Light coverage foundation recs?,"I've tried fresh wear &amp; the shade 410 is perfect but it can be finicky with my dry patches, the wet in wild tint looks beautiful but it rubs off *so* easily. I'm looking for a light coverage foundation that can handle long wear and masks. I'm fair and neutral, have deep smile lines and normal/dry skin so hopefully something with a dewy/natural finish.

Makeup,Kosas vs Rose Inc Concealer,"I have the Kosas one and adore it, just curious about an alternative. Rose inc sales are so good right now so I feel compelled to buy things I don't really need.

Makeup,How to get over the fear of being/looking absolutely terrible at makeup?,"I have eyeshadow palettes, lipsticks, foundations and such that I've always \*wanted to and meant to learn how to apply. But I'm always so deathly afraid of looking like a clown regardless of how many YT tutorials I look at, so I end up just curling my lashes, throwing on some mascara, and doing my brows. 

This has been going on for years.. I'm now in a professional line of work where I can't look like I just walked out of a circus. I get it.. no one's great at applying makeup right off the bat, but how do I get over this learning curve w/o embarrassing myself in the workplace? 

My friends aren't really makeup fiends themselves, so I can't really turn to them for advice, and I don't trust myself to have a good eye. I can appreciate beautiful makeup on others, but couldn't imagine reproducing it on myself.",2021-11-27 15:52:40
Makeup,Eyebrow not growing,"I don't know why but for forever as a child till now I've noticed that the inner part of my right eyebrow has never grown in, compared to my left one, so it literally looks like part of my eyebrow is missing and just looks silly.

Makeup,Eyeliner tips for “Phoenix Eyes”??,"So I never wear eyeliner. It’s not because I don’t want to or don’t know how, it’s just that I couldn’t find a style that was flattering to my eye shape. I looked through many different types but I couldn’t find any similar to mine. The best way I can explain my eye shape is like a mix between monolid and almond. I’m part Chinese so I decided to look into East Asian eye shapes and finally found the phoenix eye. It’s the one that resembles my eyes the best but apparently it’s not a very common shape. So I’m having a hard time finding good eye makeup tips. If there’s anyone who’s familiar with East Asian makeup/phoenix eyes, that would be greatly appreciated!

Makeup,Charlotte Tilbury Is it worth the hype update,"So Im not sure if any of you saw it but a few days ago I created a post and asked if CT was worth the hype because I was interested in the brand just iffy on the price of it. 

I ended up getting three things to test the brand out and here were my thoughts.

The airbrush powder: I really did like it no complaints it is a good powder. The formula though I know I can find at least 2 cheaper dupes for. 

The cheat lip liner in iconic nude: Probably my favorite formula for a lip liner ever and the shade is super flattering! Honestly my favorite thing out of everything I got from CT.

Pillow Talk matte lipstick: A little disappointed in the formula.

🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️Patchiness: no patchiness 


🔸️Blendability: easy to blend out 


🔸️Fallout: experienced some fallout, the most being from shimmer shade 'tonic' 


🔸️Shade Variance: this palette has a very nice 'light-to-dark' gradient. There are a few neutral transition shades, which may work for a broad range of skintones. The formula balance ratio in this palette is 13:15 (mattes to shimmers), &amp; I'm happy with a 43%/50% formula split; I think it provides enough balance. There is a matte black in this palette, which I always like - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. I didn't run into any duds with this palette. 


🔸️Formula: 


MATTES: the matte formula is what makes Sample Beauty really stand out. They are just simply good mattes. They easily work in your favor, not having to coerce them to function well. They blend, build, &amp; layer nicely. I also enjoy the nice range of blending mattes provided in this palette, so it's easy to create gradients. 


SHIMMERS: the shimmers are just basic. I didn't run into any that blew my mind, but none were awful. They just looked and performed like you would expect a standard shimmer to behave. I really like that a shimmer is provided to match each matte, so the looks created can be monochromatic. 


SEQUINS: there are only two of these in this palette, &amp; they are easily identifiable. They both have a completely matte base, but also have pinpoint reflects blended in - making it a bit more interesting. These shades can be used in the same way as a normal matte shadow, as the sparkly reflects don't really stay in place, &amp; kind of just fall away as you blend them. 


MATTE BLACK: this is a good one; having both the depth &amp; saturation I look for. It's very true-to-color, &amp; an excellent addition to this color-story.

......

🔸️Packaging: pretty boring; I don't think the exterior packaging really matches the contents of the actual palette. 

......

🔸️Recommendation: This is one of those palettes where there are SO many looks to be created, that it's almost overwhelming to know where to start. It has every primary color, plus some great blending shades. Not all rainbow palettes are well-done, but this one definitely is! Also, I wanted to point out that this is the CHEAPEST palette (by shade &amp; per gram) that I've ever reviewed! I can't believe what a great deal it is! The price per shade is 'excellent' when compared to market price. Each shadow pan holds an above-average amount of shadow. I don't think anybody would find difficulty in storing this palette. 


▪️If you are interested in this palette, I would definitely recommend it for 3 reasons: 

+ very easy to work with

+ endless amount of creative possibilities 

+ very large color-story in minimal space 

......

+ Favorite Shade: Eve

- Least Favorite Shade: Base

......

🚦 Rating: A

......

A = totally wow'd me

B = not the best, but I like it

I’ve tried IT cosmetic under eye cream for a year and I haven’t seen any changes. This really bothers me because any concealer or eyeshadow I use for my lower lid just sits in the wrinkles and makes them worse.

Everyone (MUAs, persons assisting me in Sephora etc.) has always assumed I have a warm undertone, but I’ve found that I often look orange in pictures whenever I wear foundation.

Am I actually cool? Neutral? Olive?

I know literally nothing about anything. I have very fair skin, red hair and freckles. Do you have any suggestions for eye shadow, lip gloss vs lipstick, should I put on some sort of blush if I’m not using foundation? 
I’m trying to look natural especially since it will look very obvious to everyone that I am wearing make up since I NEVER do.

Makeup,How do I get my makeup to look professionally done?,"Hi everyone! New here.

Recently I have started to do my own makeup. Right now I am more focused on the face and not so much on the eyes.

I notice that the face will look professionally done and when I do my own makeup it looks like I don’t even have makeup on. 

Now don’t get me wrong I know some love natural makeup but at times I want the dramatic look. I’m pretty light/pale skinned so I can’t really go ham on the contour/bronzer lol. Not sure if that’s the issue because I would love to also have a much more bronzed face without it looking too harsh.

 I know I probably don’t make any sense but I would love for my makeup to look I guess very noticeable. How do I achieve that? I have oily skin but I sort of hate matte foundations and love the shinny look too.",2021-11-29 01:57:08

Makeup,Recommendations for empty foundation bottle,"Hey all, I’m looking for any recommendations for an empty foundation bottle I could purchase online. I’ve found that my perfect foundation is two foundations mixed together and figured it’d be easier if I just mixed them in a bottle together, rather than mixing them on the go. I would just wait until one of my bottles is empty but that’ll probably take a while, and it’ll be my NYX can’t stop won’t stop foundation which has a really unreliable pump. The other foundation is conceal and hydrate, but there’s still like 3/4 of a bottle left.
At the moment I’m not really interested in trying to find a replacement foundation, I love the way the mixture works and it’s the first time foundation has actually matched my skin, usually the shade is slightly off, or the undertone is wrong, or it doesn’t sit right on my skin if I am lucky enough to find a match.

After a work day, my face ends up looking like [this](https://imgur.com/a/EfLvx5M). I never wore much makeup until two back-to-back pregnancies left my face super dry and red so now I want something with a lighter coverage to help the redness, but am willing to go a bit heavier if that’s what I need.

For some background info, I start my mornings washing my face, applying vitamin C serum, and started using a night cream as a moisturizer wasn’t enough for my dry skin. I then apply It Cosmetics primer followed by their CC cream with a wet Beauty Blender. Afterwards, I spray and then Pat, or spray directly to the BB a setting spray (Revolutions Hyaluronic fixing spray). A couple hours after application, I notice my makeup starting to separate in my t-zone. 6 hours later it looks awful!

Makeup,Need help with a choice for my partner,"  

Hi Makeup reddit! 

My partner always tells me about make-up and asked me so many times about advent calendar I want to pick one for her. I know make-up semi well, but I help with the following problem:  
 The problem is I am stuck between 2 calendars. She is already a make-up fan. We have things ranging from Morphe, Two faced and Urban decay. (smashbox,naked,revolution) 

Now I have found 2 calendars I think match her vibe the most, but I am stuck... I need a second (and more) opinion.... 

The choice is between:   
 **Makeup Revolution The Ultimate Glamour Collection 12 Day Advent Calendar**   
 and   
 **Makeup Revolution x Friends 12 Days Of Christmas Advent Calendar** 

The problem is she is not a Friends fan, she loves shimmers and I am wondering if any of you have experience what swatches the best, good pigmentation and more! Any advice will be appreciated",2021-12-02 19:58:52

Makeup,Eyelash care/declumping,"Guy here, and not a makeup wearer, but I have eyelash issues that I thought this community might be able to advise on.

I've always had long lashes and narrow eyes, but for the past couple of years I've been on eye drops with the side effect of making eyes darker, deeper set, and eyelash growth (when the optometrist told me that he then paused, looked at me, and added 'not that anyone would be able to tell the difference with you').  By this point my lashes have certainly gotten longer, and I have two issues.

1) they clump together a lot.  I think some is the drops leaking out of my eyes onto them, maybe some is just natural stickiness?  I try rinsing them off when I'm washing my face but that just reduces the clumping some.  Any suggestions on the best way to fight clumping?

2) They are kind of uneven, like the outer half of the top droops over my eye like a curtain often, but the inner part is more up, the lengths are not even, and they just look sort of unkempt.  Is there such thing as eyelash trimming?  Or combing?  Or something I should be doing to keep these at least looking respectable (and maybe less noticeable)?",2021-12-03 11:14:53

👉 Milani - Conceal + Perfect Smooth Finish Cream-to-Powder Foundation 


First-Impression Review: This is a foundation BALM, akin to the infamous KVD Vegan Beauty 'Good Apple' foundation. Right away, I found it difficult to get a good shade match, because you can't readily add any mixers into a balm. This is a silicone-based foundation, with 'dimethicone' being the first listed ingredient. To this, I anticipated a very smooth, pore-filling type of look. There is no fragrance to this formula, &amp; it is housed in a cute compact. To the touch, the texture feels very smooth, &amp; almost resistant. The consistency is very slippery, &amp; you can feel the transformation of cream-to-powder on your fingertips. Upon use, I found this to result in a 'skin perfecting' look. I applied it with a dense foundation brush, &amp; ended up with a natural, satin finish. This foundation is not self-setting, &amp; definitely feels like it needs to be set in place. It looks slightly heavy as I look close-up, &amp; I achieved a medium coverage level. However, you can get full-coverage if you continually build it up. I think normal/oily/combo skin types would most benefit from this.

👉 Covergirl - Clean Fresh Hydrating Concealer 


First-Impression Review: I've had my eye on this concealer since it's launch, &amp; I'm very excited to test it out today. This is supposed to be a 'hydrating' concealer with a totally vegan composition. I found it to have a very subtle 'makeup-like' scent to it. The concealer is housed in a tube with a small doefoot applicator. The texture of the formula is very soft &amp; unstructured. The consistency is very runny, &amp; serum-like. I applied it with a dense concealer brush, &amp; found it to be incredibly easy to blend-out. Immediately after dry-down, it felt very light on my skin, like I wasn't wearing makeup at all. It resulted in a very dewy, glowing undereye look. I didn't find it to crease on me at all.  I achieved light coverage with this concealer, &amp; feel that it would be a great formula to consider for 'no-makeup' makeup days. I think dry/normal/combo skin would most benefit from this concealer.

👉 Shop Miss A - Amuse Face Palette 


First-Impression Review: I just recently showcased this palette in a video, &amp; there was a lot of interest in it! I figured I'd include it today, &amp; take a more in-depth look at it. This palette contains three products: bronzer, blush, &amp; highlight. I prefer a face palette that accomplishes at least two steps, &amp; this one can fulfill three. Although slightly dark, I can make the highlight shade work on my skintone if I use it in a diffused method. Both the bronzer &amp; blushes suit me very well. All included powders have excellent blendability &amp; pigmentation. As for the actual pan sizes, I find them to be too narrow to fit my entire brush without accidentally dipping into a neighboring shade. Looking at color differentiation - I find that the blush shades are extremely similar, almost not warranting both to be in the same palette. Considering the price - I find that overall, it's a great deal.

👉 Item Beauty - Brow Chow Ultra-Fine Brow Definer 


First-Impression Review: I love, LOVE testing out brow products! Honestly, when I took a close look at this one, I thought I was going to struggle immensely. However, this was the biggest surprise of the day - this pencil worked great! It is a brow 'definer', &amp; usually definer pencils feature a large, triangular tip. On the backend, it has a miniature capped smoothing brush. Upon use, I found this pencil to be extremely smooth. It was instantaneously pigmented, too - it didn't require being built-up in order to see it.  I didn't find this formula to be overly waxy, either. Even though the tip is kind of large, if you use the edge of it, it IS able to create thin, hairlike strokes. The color I selected was also what I usually aim for.

👉 Shop Miss A - AOA Studio Eyeshadow Quad 


First-Impression Review: I've never tried any eyeshadows from Shop Miss A, so I just grabbed a quad to test out the formula. This palette doesn't have the nice 'light to dark' gradient that I look for - each shade is just a midtone. This entire palette is 75% matte &amp; 25% topper, &amp; I think it's too matte-heavy for me. I would like to see more balance. The matte shadows are all very, very similar - especially when applied to the eye.  The topper shade doesn't have a base pigment, so you are very limited as to how to use it. Upon use, I didn't get any creasing or patchiness. I got a LOT of kickback in the pans &amp; fall-out on my face.  I found all the shadows to be very easy to blend-out &amp; layer. This is a more directly pigmented formula, meaning as soon as you apply it, you are going to see the color. I personally would use a palette like this for a 'no-makeup' makeup look, with only slight sculpting. It's not my next go-to, but I still think it holds a place in my collection.

👉 Hard Candy - Flashers Plumping Serum 


First-Impression Review: I'm ALWAYS down to try a plumping gloss - the more tingling, the better. The consistency of this particular gloss is pretty thick; thick enough to form stiff peaks. There is a slight fragrance to this formula. The color that I chose is really pretty, it's an iridescent blue/purple (which is NOT good for the teeth). The applicator type is a plush paddle, &amp; I found it easy to use. Upon use, I needed to dip in the tube 4 times for my complete lip look. I found it to fill-in my lip lines, which is what I like for my glosses to do. There is also a slight stick to the finish, not terrible - but enough to promote a longer wear time. As far as the 'plumping' aspect, there was barely any tingling, &amp; I didn't notice any lip plumping results. 


➡️ Shade: Twinkle

Makeup,Buying makeup off of Amazon is mostly terrible,"I have Prime, so of course I use it bc I don’t have a ton of money. 

I only buy well known, quality brands but I keep getting products that are expired, about to expire, unsealed, etc. 

How do you make makeup buying on Amazon work?! Even if it’s from Amazon, there’s still a lot of issues.",2021-12-03 11:25:42
Makeup,does everyone just look crusty when they wear foundation or is that just me??,"really though, I take great care of my skin, exfoliate every few days, moisturize, get regular facials etc. I am a professional esthetician.  so if that means anything. I know that my skin is dry and needs a lot of moisture so thats what I give her.

I think my skin actually looks fine without foundation on, But some days If I want to dress up I do like to have a little extra coverage, especially if i am going to be drinking at all because I get really red in the face.

my only issue is, EVERY time I wear foundation it looks so CRUSTY. 

I have no idea if I am just overly critical of how it looks because i don't wear foundation much but it honestly looks gross up close. does every ones skin just look crusty up-close when they wear foundation??

&amp;#x200B;

for context:

 I put the foundation on and all the moisture has just been sucked out of my face and within a few seconds i am left with textured look that i absolutely can not stand. I have used more ""CC"" cream foundations as well and they are like almost too oily and leave my skin looking greasy patchy? its like all of the pores on my face fill with the foundation while every other area is just left uncovered. or  Its like not even really covering my skin so much as its sitting patchily on top of my face when you look up close.  it looks bad in my opinion so idk. I havent really noticed it on other women when I go out but I guess i am also not that close to their face so idk if I dont see it or if its just not an issue for them.

I generally do my face routine, lightly exfoliate, moisturize, let that dry for 20 min then apply my foundation with a moist beauty blender, but I have tried brushes, and fingers too and all just seem to end up looking the same. some times I use primer but that seems to not make much of a difference if I use it or not so I just dont bother lol",2021-12-03 11:41:29

Makeup,Colourpop pretty fresh foundation…,"If you use this, what primer works best for you? I’m having a hard time keeping this foundation lasting.

Makeup,Recommendations for a chartreuse lipstick? (that can also be found in Europe),"What I'm looking for is something similar to the lipstick shade that Jolyne from JJBA wears. I saw that J* has a lipstick called No Offense, but I don't feel comfortable buying from him so I'd rather find better alternatives. Where can I find such a shade? Should I just grab an eyeshadow and turn it into a lipstick?

I want something that can also be found in Europe, that is matte and not a gloss.

Thanks! Any other suggestions are welcomed!",2021-12-04 05:34:44

🏅CURRENT RATINGS ASSESSMENT: 

+ E.L.F. Cosmetics: 4.2 / 5.0 (2,035 ratings)

+ Target: 4.2 / 5.0 (2,019 ratings)

+ Walmart: 4.2 / 5.0 (1,962 ratings)

+ Amazon: 4.3 / 5.0 (95 ratings)

+ Ulta Beauty: 4.2 / 5.0 (2,027 ratings)

.............................

TOTAL AVERAGE RATING: 4.2 / 5.0

........

Initial Application: (1530) looks exactly the same on both sides (right side w/ curled lashes &amp; primer), dry formula, exceptionally pitch-black in color, no application mess, gave me superb volume, great length, didn't notice any curling, no clumping. The wand is quite large for the lower lashes.

........

🕑 2-Hour Mark: (1730) [still wearable] both sides just simply look 'worn'. Each side looks less lifted, like it already lost all of its initial volume. There are no smudges or flaking at this time.

........

🕒 3-Hour Mark: (1830) [still wearable] a few flakes around the entire right side (w/ curled lashes &amp; primer), the lashes themselves look the same as last check-in.

........

🕔 5-Hour Mark: (2030) [still wearable] some small flaking around both eyes now, both sides' lashes look the same as last check-in.

........

🕗 8-Hour Mark: (2330) [still wearable] same amount of flakes, but nothing noteworthy.

........

🧼 Micellar Water Test: PASS; came off very easily with simple micellar water. I soaked a cotton pad, applied &amp; massaged my lashes for 10-15 seconds, &amp; wiped clean.

........

🤓 Final Thoughts: 

▪️Flaking: flaking began at the 3-hr mark

▪️Transfer: no transfer at all 

▪️Packaging: cute, purple is my favorite color

▪️Brush: big &amp; tough to control

▪️Formula: dry formula, volumizing, not clumpy

▪️Value: using the 'average' amount of mascara to be 0.27 fl oz &amp; $10, this particular tube has 0.36 fl oz for $7. For an additional 0.09 fl oz of product, you are paying below the average price.

▪️Results: the mascara stayed lightweight &amp; relatively fluffed all day long, both sides lost their any sign of curl at the 2-hr mark.  

▪️Lower Lashline: no; brush is hard to maneuver for the lowers

▪️Recommend: yes; I think this mascara is good enough for an all-day, 8-hour wear with minimal repercussions.

Makeup,Ugh rubberised packaging,"I just got out a NARS eyeshadow duo that I haven’t used in a few months. Like every other NARS product I have ever owned, the compact has gone sticky and tacky thanks to that stupid rubberised coating they put on everything.

Makeup,Palette Review &amp; Pictorial - ABH/Norvina: Pro Pigment Palette Vol. 2,"[Pictures are available on my profile, if you are interested!]


✅ New Saturday Palette Pictorial &amp; Review

......

➡️ NOTE: This is MY opinion &amp; experience; regarding the palette quality. As always, use/buy the makeup that makes YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun. 


🌟 Also, this is my first time deep diving into this palette, &amp; are my true impressions. As I continue to use it in more ways, I will update you as to how my thoughts on its performance change/develop. 

......

ABH/Norvina Cosmetics - Pro Pigment Palette Vol. 2 ✌

......

👁 Look Created: Intense Inner-Corner

......

⚫ Packaging: 25 shades are 1.8g each, rectangle-shaped pans, luxury plastic case packaging w/ gold chevron motifs, bi-fold, palette name &amp; brand is front &amp; center, luxury-weight, magnetic closure, medium square shape, large mirror inside, pans are not intended to be removed, shade names are designated southwards of each shade

......

⚫ Country of Origin: China

......

⚫ # of Shades in Palette: 25 (mixture of eyeshadows &amp; pressed pigments; pressed pigments are not 'eye safe' according to FDA law)

......

⚫ Formulas Included (according to MY observation): 3 formulas (15 mattes, 3 sequins, 7 metallics)

......

⚫ Designation: rainbow-esque

......

⚫ Dexterity Concerns: yes; the magnet on this palette is very strong &amp; can be very difficult to open. Also the size &amp; weight of this palette is very trying to hold in the hands.

......

⚫ Type of Press: soft - lots of kickback in pans, a lot of fallout on my face; recommend doing eyes before base with this palette.

......

⚫ Extra Information: this is a professional-grade artistry palette, the color-story is aqua-themed, dermatologist-tested &amp; non-comedogenic, cruelty-free, vegan, 18-month PAO on back of palette

......

🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️Patchiness: no patchiness 


🔸️Blendability: easy to blend out 


🔸️Fallout: experienced some fallout, the most being from matte shade 'C2' 


🔸️Shade Variance: this palette has a very nice 'light-to-dark' gradient. There are no traditional neutral transition shades included in this particular color-story. The formula balance ratio in this palette is 15:7 (mattes to metallics), &amp; I think a 60% / 28% formula split leans matte-heavy. There's not an equal formulation balance. There is a matte black in this palette, which I always like - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. I didn't run into any duds with this palette. 


🔸️Formula: 


MATTES: this matte formula is so nice. This is (hands-down) one of my FAVORITE matte formulas ever! It lies down very pigmented, &amp; it doesn't blend away (even the extremely light-toned shades). It's very easy to create a gradient with this palette. The shades layer very nicely, aren't patchy at all, &amp; are incredibly intense! 


METALLICS: these are far from the best metallics I've ever used, but they sure are pretty. There are some really rare colors in here. Some of the shades have a base pigment, &amp; other ones don't. I really enjoy the mixture. I also like that this palette isn't oversaturated with metallic shades. I also appreciate that they pick up well on a brush! 


SEQUINS: there are only three of these shades in here, &amp; they are very intensely pigmented shades with very tiny pinpoint glitters in them. The glitters aren't extremely noticeable, but they do catch the light if layered up nicely. I would consider this formula to be approached more as a 'satin', as that's how it practically functions. 


MATTE BLACK: this is a good one; having both the depth &amp; saturation I look for. It's very true-to-color, &amp; an excellent addition to this color-story.

......

🔸️Packaging: I really like this packaging. It keeps the shadows nicely protected, &amp; it looks pretty cool! I also think the exterior packaging matches the interior color-story.

......

🔸️Recommendation: This is a crazy color-story - it really doesn't make much sense. It makes creating looks much more fun, &amp; I feel inspired by this particular color-story. This was VERY fun to use, &amp; the quality was astounding. This has definitely made its way up into being one of my favorite palettes that I own. I love the quality of the Norvina formula so much, I am bound to collect all the palettes! The price per shade is 'excellent'. Each shadow pan holds an above average amount of shadow. You may find difficulty in storing this palette, due to its immense size. I am keeping this in my collection. 


▪️If you are interested in this palette, I would definitely recommend it for 3 reasons: 

+ incredibly easy to blend 

+ very inspiring color-story

+ inclusion of rare shades

......

+ Favorite Shade: A4

- Least Favorite Shade: A3

Makeup,Why have I never tried eyeshadows wet before?!?!,"Realized while watching makeup YouTube that I own several wet-to-dry formulas and I never thought to wet my brush cause I know the beauty YouTubers do it but it seemed like it would make the eyeshadow too intense. Tried it, love it, and it’s still “subtle” because the shadows I’m using are a satin, not a pow-highlight-glitter shade. It’s just more even, richer, and staying put more. 10/10, can’t stop looking at myself in the mirror, would recommend.",2021-12-05 03:37:44

Makeup,How to make small eyes appear bigger?,"F21 here. I have very fair skin, dark brunette hair, and blue eyes. While I appreciate the colour of my eyes, I’m not a fan of the shape. I’m not exactly sure how to describe my eye shape - they’re somewhat hooded, but also round? I’m not sure. I get told that my eyes aren’t small, but they’re not huge either. I’ve tried tips on how to make eyes appear bigger with makeup, and yet in photos they don’t quite “pop”. It doesn’t help that I don’t have a ton of eyelid space, either. I’ve always admired the foxy, almond eye shape, and wish I could make my eyes appear like that. I am wondering if anyone has any other suggestions other than what I already currently do, which I list below.

What I do to try to make my eyes appear bigger are winged eyeliner, concealer under my eyes, blue/navy pencil eyeliner from the center of the bottom lash line out, lightening my waterline with white eyeliner, use highlighter/shimmer on inner corner of eye, make my eyebrows arched, curl my eyelashes, and use a good quality mascara that I apply along my upper lashes (I even do another thickening coat, but make sure it’s not clumpy). I also avoid applying heavy eyeliner on my upper lid, and opt for a wing on the outer edges, though I usually make the wing part thick. I’m somewhat confused though as some websites say that liquid eyeliner (which I use) makes eyes appear smaller, so I’m not sure which is true. Some days I don’t wanna put on too much makeup so I’ll just apply mascara but I’m worried my eyes will look small without the other add-ons.

I’m aware that applying false eyelashes would enhance my eyes, but I’d prefer tips/suggestions that don’t require the use of them. Are there other methods I should try (for e.g., with eyeshadow)? Thank you!",2021-10-28 18:06:54

Makeup,How do I get my makeup to last longer?,"I think I use products that are meant to help my makeup to last but it never seems to last all day at school. I was just wondering if there are any techniques that can help or if I should be using powder over a larger portion of my face (currently it’s just under my eyes and chin but I don’t really bake, just press it into my skin with a brush). The products I use are two elf primers (putty and mint melt cooling primer), the maybelline super stay foundation and the urban decay setting spray. I also use other products such as contour and highlight but I don’t think they would affect they longevity of my makeup.

Makeup,Need help finding a similar shaped brush," The brush in question is the [Bobbi Brown Smokey Eye Liner Brush](http://imgur.com/a/0cxor8s) that I bought back in 2013.

I'm  not sure if the Bobbi Brown still makes this brush to the same quality,  I recently bought their eye sweep brush to replace my old one but the quality was so much worse than the same brush from 8 years ago.  It was very scratchy and had a completely different shape.  On the other hand, I also bought their eye blender brush at the same time and the quality is amazing, soft that it doesn't irritate my eyes and not too firm.  It seems Bobbi Brown's brush quality is hit or miss these days, so if someone has bought the Smokey Eye Liner brush in the recent years and could provide some feedback, that would be greatly appreciated.

I have the Zoeva 238 eye shader (doesn't have the same thickness/firmness) and Sigma E21 (extremely prickly and irritates my skin).  Other suggestions are welcome, thanks in advance!",2021-10-30 16:51:30

To me it looks like a peachy/coral rose, definitely no cool undertones. I also love the shine it has, just natural, not glittery nor too matte. 

I think they worked with L'Oréal on this film but since it's already so old, most of the things were probably discontinued or better products have beeb released in the meantime. If anyone has suggestions for a good, long lasting, kiss and eating proof lip colour in this exact shade, by all means. Preferably drugstore or affordable brands but for this exact shade I'd be willing to shell out.",2021-10-30 20:24:07

Makeup,How to apply weird pointy shaped lipstick to a tiny human?,"So, I’m a dad. I have a 5 year old daughter. She likes makeup. And for Halloween, we’re finally dabbling in some. My wife doesn’t do makeup, never has. We ha a friend who was able to help instruct with eyeshadow, and I’m not doing to bad there.

But the lipstick… it needs some Jesus.

Me and the friend went and bought some decent makeup, because the Halloween store stuff was just terrible.

Anyway, daughter is doing this unicorn rainbow fair princess costume? And so we ended up with this black radiance metallic purple lipstick. The problem… it’s weird and pointy like a crayon. Like, I’ve never seen any shaped like this. Neither has our family friend. And it’s throwing us all off.

Tried applying some… because you know, practice… but it’s all kinda jacked up. I don’t even know if it’s the shape or a general incompetence on my part.

I tried doing a YouTube tutorial search… but it’s more just reviews. And it’s like… how? How did you just get it to glide on perfectly like that?

So, I guess I’m after some advice if anyone has any?",2021-10-31 01:30:03
Makeup,a rant about Ulta,"i really need to rant right now because i am so peeved.

my birthday is tomorrow and i didn't know until i went into an ulta near my moms place (near the beginning of the month) that as a platinum member i'm supposed to get a second birthday gift aside from the free item i already got.

so about 2 weeks ago i emailed ulta asking about what this second item was supposed to be. well the person who responded was very hush hush and secret about what i was supposed to get ""i'm really not supposed to tell you"" but he sent me a list of items platinum members get i then realized i should be getting a $10 off coupon... it's now the day before my birthday and the day before the last day to use that coupon, and it still hadn't arrived.

I got a little annoyed and started a chat with an ulta beauty specialist who sent me a code for a coupon and then weather on purpose or not deleted the code before i could copy it and ended the chat. obviously anything could change before tomorrow. but i suddenly understand why Sephora has so much support where i live despite the fact that ulta had more stores. 

anyway i just needed to rant about this experience cuz i think i need to step back from ulta at this stage. this is not the first time i've had bad service but i think it might be the last time i accept it from ulta. thank you for reading",2021-10-31 03:06:12

Makeup,Palette Review &amp; Pictorial - Morphe: The Jaclyn Hill Palette,"[Pictures are available on my profile, if you are interested!]

✅ New Saturday Palette Pictorial &amp; Review

......

➡️ NOTE: This is MY opinion &amp; experience; regarding the palette quality. As always, use/buy the makeup that makes YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun. 


🌟 Also, this is my first time deep diving into this palette, &amp; are my true impressions. As I continue to use it in more ways, I will update you as to how my thoughts on its performance change/develop. 

......

Morphe Brushes - The Jaclyn Hill Palette ✌

......

👁 Look Created: Spotlight Eye

......

⚫ Packaging: 35 shades are 1.6g each, circle-shaped pans, white cardboard packaging, bi-fold, palette brand &amp; name is on front, luxe-weight, magnetic closure, large rectangle shape, no mirror inside, pans may possibly be removable (currently waiting on testing tool to arrive for more definitive assessment), shade identification is designated on a completely separate cardstock insert, to which I taped inside the inner cover. Keep in mind that the NEWLY released version of this palette has the shade names printed southward of each shadow.

......

⚫ Country of Origin: China

......

⚫ # of Shades in Palette: 35 (all eyeshadows)

......

⚫ Formulas Included: 3 formulas (17 mattes, 3 satins, &amp; 15 shimmers) 

......

⚫ Designation: warm-toned, 'pop-of-blue'

......

⚫ Dexterity Concerns: none

......

⚫ Type of Press: soft - lots of kickback in pans, slight fallout on my face; recommend doing eyes first with this palette. 

......

⚫ Extra Information: created in collaboration with long-time Beauty Influencer Jaclyn Hill, each shade has a unique history &amp; descriptor, cruelty-free, NOT vegan* (please see note below), no PAO on palette (may have been on original box) 


🌟 Note: there are two versions of this palette floating around - the OG palette that launched in 2017, &amp; the newly made-over version that relaunched in 2020. There has been immense controversy &amp; dispute surrounding this relaunch, because the original palette was made with a vegan formula. 


Upon relaunch, the formula changed to one that was no longer vegan - yet both Morphe &amp; Jaclyn Hill have stated that the relaunched palette contains the EXACT same proprietary formula. The entire formula had, in fact, changed, including additional ingredients carmine, coconut oil, &amp; shea. 


The palette that I'm currently using for this review, is the 2017 OG vegan palette with the unchanged formula.

......

💰 Price: $39.00 • (Morphe Brushes)

💲 Price: $1.11/shade 

......

PRICE PER SHADE SCALE:

&lt;$2=excellent; $3-$4=affordable; $5-$8=meh; $9-$15=expensive; &gt;$16=very expensive 


PRICE PER GRAM:

+ $0.69/gram  

......

🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️Patchiness: no patchiness 


🔸️Blendability: very easy to blend out 


🔸️Fallout: experienced slight fallout, the most being from matte shade 'Enchanted' 


🔸️Shade Variance: this palette has a nice 'light-to-dark' gradient. There are a few neutral transition shades for a range of skintones. This includes an excellent formula balance ratio. 


🔸️Formula: 


MATTES: these mattes were very pleasant to use. They effectively blended with every brush I tried, I got them to easily build &amp; layer, I didn't experience any unwanted patchiness. Each color was definitely pigmented, &amp; the color similarity was on point. I knew I could rely on getting the same shade on my eye as to what I was seeing in the pan. 


SATINS: there are only a few of these, but I really like them. The microglitters are far smaller in size when compared to one of the shimmer shades. Applied, these have a very smooth base, with a subtle illumination that enlivens the most drab areas. 


SHIMMERS: some of these shimmers are slight, whereas other ones are pretty foiled! They are more chunky in comparison to the satin shades, &amp; have larger micro particles in them. Each shimmer shade in this palette has a base pigment, so you can use these in a variety of ways. They apply very easily with a brush, which is important to me. 


MATTE BLACK: here is my customary comment on the included matte black - the most important of all shades in a palette. To make it simple - I like this one. It's not the best I've used, but it's pretty nice. Nothing bad to say about it!

......

🔸️Packaging: nice; it just reminds me of Jaclyn Hill, so I think they did a really great job of picking packaging that speaks well of the creator. 

......

🔸️Recommendation: I've used this palette here-and-there over the years, but I never really paid attention to if it was GOOD or not. Overall, I was amazed at how easy it was to use, I love the amount of shadows to select from, &amp; all the tones just go so well together. I really do enjoy this palette, &amp; have been very happy with the results. The price per shade is 'excellent' when compared to market price. Each shadow pan holds an above-average amount of shadow per pan. People may find difficulty in storing this palette, due to its extremely large size. I am keeping this in my collection. 


▪️If you are interested in this palette, I would definitely recommend it.

+ easy to blend

+ range of colors to select from

+ great balance of formulas

......

+ Favorite Shade: Diva

- Least Favorite Shade: Twerk

......

🚦 Rating: A

⭐ RATING LEGEND:

A = totally wow'd me

B = not the best, but I like it

C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product

D = this didn't work out for me

F = I totally hate this

Makeup,Foundation flaking off on my nose no matter what I do.,"I’ve always kept up with my skincare, I wash my face twice a day and moisturise as well as using serums here and there. My nose feels very smooth and hydrated, yet the second I apply foundation/concealer it instantly flakes. I’ve tried beauty blenders, brushes, my fingers, all to no avail. I’ve tried primers, I’ve tried powdering my face before application (saw this on tiktok), and nothing has ever worked! Even if i just put concealer on my nose, it flakes horribly on the tip of my nose and nowhere else. 
I’m not the best with makeup but I know my basics, but this is a problem I’ve struggled with since I began using makeup a year or two ago. I have a red nose/cheek area so I do like to cover it up from time to time, but the second I apply foundation it flakes instantly.

Makeup,"I feel like there should be colour codes for every makeup product, or at least from well known brands.","Especially lip products. I mean, colour codes like when buying art supplies. You often get a pigmentation code, like py129. If a product has that colour code I know it will be a green/gold/yellowish colour.

 That way you get a better understanding of what the colour will look like, and if you're searching for a specific colour in a product with a certain formula, that gets easier too. 

Ofc colours will look differently depending on what kind of binding it is mixed with, but still. It would make things much easier imo. And, yes, it is very good that we can find reviews with swatches when ordering online. But still, it would be a dream if makeup companies did this.

Makeup,Interested in completely overhauling makeup collection,"I use a “cc” cream from it cosmetics with a setting powder but I’m not in love with how it works with my combination skin- it looks great in the morning when I first put it on although a bit cakey in the powdered areas, but then it melts and looks oily rather quickly throughout the day. I have their under eye concealer also but I hate it - very thick and hard to apply so I pretty much just rely on the cc cream but it’s not the greatest coverage for dark circles. I was recently married and my makeup artist used Mac products and I liked the result. I know that like 95% of this was probably her technique, but now I’m left wondering if I should be using different products.

Makeup,Eyeshadow won’t stick to inner corners.,"I’ve been struggling with applying eyeshadow for a few years now. No matter what I do, no shadow seems to want to stick to my inner corners. I’ve tried prepping with several primers (mac eye primer, NYX, Too faced, Mac paint pot), moisturizing the area, packing in the color as much as I can, and still, the product applies patchy and comes off shortly after. 

The skin in that area is a bit hooded, so maybe that’s contributing to the issue?

I ended up getting one of the elf concealer brushes to apply the lipstick. Ended up sort of dabbing it on the lipstick and brushing it on. It was a significantly better outcome than the first attempt. It was oddly similar to dry brush painting miniatures.

Additionally, based on the whims of a 5 year old, the tiny human decided she did not want the eye shadow. So literally the only thing she wanted to wear was the lipstick.

It lasted about 5 minutes into the evening, at which point it was largely removed by her eating a hershey bar. One of my friends was handing out full bars.

All in all, I guess we’ll count it as a win.

Thank you to everyone for the advice.",2021-11-01 08:16:08
Makeup,Concealer/foundation making eye bags more obvious?,"Hi all, first time posting on Reddit... I just recently started using makeup again after about 2-3 years and I've been having an issue with the foundation/concealer I'm using making my eye bags look way more obvious than when I don't have any makeup on? The darkness is concealed but the under eye circles/bags stand out so much more. If it makes any difference I use Fenty foundation and Nars concealer. Using these before didn't seem to give me this issue but it's probably just my undereye situation has gotten worse. Any suggestions to what I can do to fix this?

Makeup,Male. Brothers wedding coming up. Want to contour my face whilst looking like I haven't got any makeup on,"Hi people ;) 

Wedding is in 3 weeks. I'm not in my best shape but I'm trying.

I want to contour my face, and I want it to stay on my face even when I sweat, or get really cold outside. It's an evening wedding. The YouTube tutorials I've seen have people put on a lot of concealer/foundation - I want to avoid these. 

From what I have gathered, this could be my plan of action:

1. Moisturizing cream - a LOT of it. 
2. Pore reducing primer on the cheek areas 
3. Powder contour thing - and make a Zoolander pose face, apply the contour thing on the hollows
4. Use a beauty blender and dab the hell out of it, but softly 
5. Dab gently with a makeup brush
6. Translucent setting powder (not translucent powder?)
7. Setting spray
8. Act cool.

What do you think? Is there anything I should do differently? 

I have put on concealer and foundation before on my face and personally for me it looks way too obvious for someone who's trying to look like they have nothing on. If I put concealer, sometimes especially if the weather gets colder (which it is now), it flakes too. 

I am Iraqi and have medium brown skin.

I use clear mascara whenever I put on makeup, so I have *some* experience with it, just not black or any other mascara. I've never used eyeliner, but I am willing to try that as well. I'm honestly nervous with trying any dark colors like black or brown because of how pale my skin is, but I'll never know how it looks until I try it. Any recommendations on what lashes I should try?

Makeup,How do I work with cream/liquid highlighter?,"
I‘m actually quite experienced with make up (or thought I was) but realized I don’t really know how to work with cream highlighter. My main problem is that I don’t know how to layer products and that my cheekbones are so close to my undereyes. So if I apply foundation and concealer followed by the highlighter it does not layer well and dissolves the product underneath. I’ve tried multiple ones. Same goes for applying after setting with powder, which is not a surprise. And it’s really difficult to set my undereyes without getting powder on my cheeks.

Let’s pretend for a second it would work to apply it on top: do I leave it as is? Do I set it with a powder (highlighter) and how do I apply powder blush without everything getting caught up in the highlighter? Do I need to use all cream? Is liquid highlighter just not for everyone?

Makeup,Illiterate when it comes to makeup/skincare/etc. HELPPPP,"A little backstory before I ask my actual question; I barely ever do my makeup because my skin is like my worst enemy. I’m also very fair skinned with a lot of redness on my cheeks and nose. My skin is either super dry or super oily, never in between. When I do my make up I use matte products, and still end up with the dewy look which I hate. Either dewy from being oily or flakey from being dry. I was never taught how to do really good makeup and watching tutorials it seemed my ending results never looked the same as theirs lol. I’m starting to get huge dark baggy circles under my eyes and I guess what is considered crows feet near the corners of my eyes. I’m only 25 😩. I sometimes use a moisturizer maybe 3-4 times a week. Every one I’ve tried has made my face look super oily even if I dab it off some it just comes back looking oily. Now that I’ve given a little background of my skin type and such. I’m looking for some skin care lotions/creams/oils/etc that are good for dark circles and/or bags. Along with something for the wrinkles near my eyes. I’m also looking for a daily moisturizer/primer/product that would be good for my type of skin, especially for doing makeup. I’m willing to try expensive products if they actually work.

Makeup,Makeup colour matching advice for wedding! (And maybe in general),"Hello Makeup community! I have a wedding to go to in a few days and I’ve only just realised I have no idea what I’m going to do for makeup, I’d be fine with just my trusty foundation, powder and eyeliner but if I could glam up a bit, that’d be nice :D
I was hoping for some colour advice/ideas as I feel I’m already being a bit risky colour wise?

I have blue hair with dark purple tips, a bright red dress and pale skin and small lips.
I love lipstick but never wear it, I think it looks great on others but not really on me, I’m hoping it’s because I haven’t found the right shade for me? The only lipstick I feel has ever really looked good on me is black, which I rarely wear and I know is an absolute nono for the wedding/look.

Does anyone have any advice on lipstick and/for eye shadow colours considering the colours I already have?

Makeup,Help! Best setting powder for combination/aging skin—or do I need to move onto a new foundation?,"I’ve been extremely dry skinned for years, but have recently gotten very oily in my t-zone, especially the forehead area. 

I tend to avoid ultra matte or powder foundations as they leave me looking cakey (clinging to my dry areas, making my skin feel tight, and settling into my fine lines.) 

My HG foundation for years has been Nars Sheer Glow as it always looked great on my dry skin and never required setting powder to look relatively matte-natural on me. Sadly, it’s starting to look like an oil slick almost as soon as I put it on.

Any suggestions for a talc-free setting powder that will mattify me without settling into lines or giving me a weird powdery cast?

Alternatively—any suggestions for a matte or demi-matte foundation that actually works and looks good on aging combo skin?

I might be asking too much. Feel free to (kindly) shoot me straight if I’m being unreasonable.",2021-11-04 06:15:41

I’ve tried so many different types of makeup remover (micellar water, makeup balm, oil, lash soap) but there’s always a bit of makeup left in my lashes, I think my problems with removal may be related to me having triple eyelash rows.

Makeup,Looking for a dupe that doesn’t leave my eyes as bald as Dwayne Johnson!,"As above. I’ve been using the L’Oreal Unlimited mascara to gigantic results - super easy to apply, goes on quick, lashes look incredible. Wet formula that doesn’t take‍ much work. However, it’s a BITCH to get off, despite the fact that it’s not waterproof. My micellar water is just not cutting it, and I’m losing lashes at an alarming rate. No strict budget, just looking for something that works! Better than sex takes too much work (might just be a lack of chemistry), and the few supermarket brands I’ve bought since have been unbelievable mediocre. If I had to be picky, I’d say something a little less clumpy than the L’Oréal one would be ideal, but a formula close to that would be ace. Cheers! Ps. The rock is great.

Makeup,Is…is Shimmer…Dead?,"This is hard for me to ask. Maybe cuz I’ve crossed the other side of my 30’s and own over 11,000 neutral palettes all purchased for that Pop of Bronze Foil Gold Shimmer. We’ve been at it since high school and we’re happily married and had several Shimmer babies. But like…should we get a divorce? 
It’s just that lately I’ve been looking more at Mattes (I know I know, outside of my marriage how disgusting). I’ve always thought Mattes were so boring! I needed that pep, that sparkle, that Oomph. I was young! Matte was always a reliable friend and everything, laying the base, contouring your peeps, blending your shit, helping you move. But at the end of the night, you know I be fucking with Shimmer. Get my brush WET, dig in deep, lay it on thick. We were happy.

But like, lately I’ve been hanging more and more with Skincare. And I like what it’s done for ME. I’m glowing more, my skin feels healthier. And now my vibe with Shimmer is all off. My Highlight doesn’t get me off as much and just makes me look sweaty. And my beloved Shimmer lid kinda looks like it’s trying too hard now. It doesn’t look dignified partying like that at our age, screaming for attention. 

But you know…the love is still there. I can’t deny it. We have so much Herstory together and I just…I dunno. 

Anyone else feel this way sometime? Anyway, thanks for listening…

Makeup,Extreme self esteem problems,"I’m a teen in high school and around 3-4 years ago I ran into some issues with my weight. I thought that skipping meals would make people like me more since in middle school I was made fun of but not necessarily for my weight ever. I was very awkward and what most people would consider unattractive. So I began to drop weight like crazy and eventually my friends said they’d tell someone. Fast forward a year and I started to get into makeup, it started out very natural and light but it turned into a full face for school every single day. The guys and girls that made fun of me now paid extra attention to me. I was called beautiful by everyone even some of my siblings guy friends and soccer teammates. Problem is that I look disgusting without it and I have to wake up early every morning to put on this mask. And even after years my weight problem has never gone away, I throw out lunch at school to stay under a weight and I refuse breakfast. I get extreme guilt and panic when I go over a set number of cals. I cant tell my mom or an adult because my own mom even said I’m wearing too much makeup and asked what I’d do if these boys saw me without it. And when I tried opening up to her about my diet problem when it first started my phone was taken and that was that. Now I can go without social media I’m not like that but that’s how I’d talk to my friends who have my back. My mom cares but just don’t understand. I’m so obsessed with makeup and my weight and I know I’m unattractive without it. I don’t know what to do.",2021-09-30 00:23:17

Makeup,Should There Be Travel Sized Foundation?,"I’d like to hear what you guys have to say :)

For me, I think that companies should start creating smaller sizes of foundation because it’s something that is so unique to everyone, but there are too many options out there. How can someone find their “holy grail” or discover a brand that suits them better if they’re spending time finishing up their current full sized bottle.

Full sized foundations take a long time to get through, and bottles can expire before it’s all used up. This is especially true for those two alternate between different brands at once. There will never be enough time to finish it before it expires. Not to mention the bulkiness of bottles of liquid foundation that can be a struggle while traveling. 

Id rather try the mini sizes to test out everything in a foundation without having to be fully committed to spending $40 on a bottle of foundation that looked good as a swatch but not on my face. 

Sample sized packets usually only contain enough for one application, which isn’t enough to test out the long term effects of wear (if it contributes to acne, too drying ect.) 

We have travel sized everything from lip kits to eyeliner, it would be nice if mini sizes of foundation were offered as well. 

I can see how some people could say travel sized is wasteful packaging, but I find that having to toss out a half empty expired full-size wasteful as well. 

Also Im aware that expiration dates don’t always have to be followed, but after a few years of almost daily use, I think my foundation has to go no matter how full it is.  

So should there be a mini/ travel sized foundation in your opinion?",2021-09-30 10:53:26
Makeup,Foundation mixer for a *slight* touch of luminosity?,"Hey folks! I'm looking for some suggestions on a foundation mixer.


As summer is winding down, my combo/oily skin is getting a bit less oily. At the beginning of summer I started using the Urban Decay Stay Naked foundation and I LOVE it. Perfect shade match, lasts as long as I need it to, stays looking fresh all day. But as my skin is getting closer to ""normal"" and less oily (which is typical for me in the fall/winter months) my foundation is starting to look a little dry. Not cakey, at least not yet, but dry. I am not at all in the mood to shop for another foundation lol so I'd rather mix something into it to tone down the matte finish a bit.



I tried the Glow Recipe dew drops and honestly it was exactly what I was after. Not sure if the magic is in the drops or the foundation, but I mixed equal amounts of both and didn't sacrifice coverage in any way, and the foundation was still matte but with just a *touch* of luminosity. Perfection. So of course my stupidly sensitive skin had a reaction to the dew drops. My cheeks got red and inflamed and got a mess of small red bumps everywhere. Just lovely!



Next I brought out an old tube of the Dr. Brandt luminizer primer and mixed that in with the foundation. It was nice enough, definitely toned down the dry appearance, but it didn't look as natural as the dew drops did. Neither does any of my moisturizers, and those also sheered the foundation a lot more.



Does anyone have any suggestions for a good mixer? Anything out there similar to the dew drops? I just really loved the touch of luminosity without having any shine, shimmer, or glitter. I'd prefer to stay from oils, I've had too many do me wrong in the past. But I'm open to just about anything else, primer, serum, moisturizer, etc. I'd prefer something I can get at Sephora since it's most convenient for me, but I'm not married to that idea.



Thanks in advance and sorry for the novel!",2021-09-30 11:27:37

Makeup,Face makeup for rosacea?,"My rosacea has gotten worse recently and I don’t know how to cover it.

I’m looking to cover the redness in a natural way, so more buildable coverage- it’s ok if some color peeks through, just a little evening. The texture, bumpiness, and makeup separation is the real problem. I currently use cicapair green color corrector which works well as a primer (not sure if i should be using primer under it lol) and helps a natural finish because i use less makeup on top but I haven’t found any bb cream/light coverage foundation that doesn’t emphasize my texture.

Makeup,My colors don’t work anymore!! (Choosing makeup in 30s),"I’m 32 and over the past several months I’ve been realizing with increasing awareness that my makeup colors that worked for me amazingly for the last 10 years don’t work at all anymore. They literally don’t match my skin anymore, look weird and clownish instead of bright and fresh and - I don’t get it. I know styles change but this isn’t that. The colors literally no longer compliment me.

Not only that, the foundation that worked just last year seems… oddly bright and unnatural to my eyes now. I think I’m still getting away with it but… I seriously don’t know what to do.

It was between this palette, the new Patrick Ta one or Too Faced Born This Way eyeshadow palette but I think the latter two have pink toned shades which aren’t my favourite.

Makeup,"Soft, blendable eyeliner recs? I got 9 eyeliners from Stila that are all broken!","Yeahhhh like the title says, I got 9 pencil eyeliners from Stila during Ulta’s 21 Days of Beauty sale. They were $11 each and I used $60 in rewards for them, so I thought I was getting an amazing deal. 

The colors are PERFECT. The formula is so soft and amazing. The packaging though… none of the liners retract!! I can’t roll them up to get more product or roll them down to protect the product. It’s crazy! I actually thought I was losing my mind. I brought one to the store and asked the sales rep if I was insane… she couldn’t get it either and ended up breaking the eyeliner. I read the reviews; apparently this is a common issue. I’m returning the rest and am so disappointed! 

What are your favorite eyeliners that are soft, smudgy, and easy to blend? I love smoked out liner looks and really like interesting colors. I won’t use them in my waterline so they don’t need to be waterproof or have amazing staying power. Something slim and retractable (not one you sharpen) would be ideal.

Makeup,makeup tips for masculine faces,"Info: please excuse any spelling errors, I'm from europe lol

Hi all! 
I geniunely love wearing make up but these days I don't really have the time and patience to do a full glam everyday and I try to stick to a more natural look, since I work at an office. Problem is: I have very strong masculine features and people sometimes even confuse me for a guy, which is...not so great to hear, for me personally. Basically I look like my dad, but with longer hair. 🙃
Usually I put on a heavy eyeliner, to accentuate my eyes, but I really love the no makeup look with just a bit of brown eyeshadow used as eyeliner. I have a slight 5 o clock shadow on my upper lip (thanks dad for making me extra hairy), a huuuuge forehead and of course thin but very defined lips, which are impossible to overline without looking ridiculous. (I've tried, trust me)
I've been thinking about a forehead reduction and lip fillers, which would solve 99% of my problems but probably add up a lot of new ones and make me poor, considerind I'd have to touch up the latter every few months and risk to look like a duck, with all that bad migration I've been seeing. 

So are there any girls struggling with this as well? Do you guys have any tips for me? I'd prefer to wear less makeup, just doing a cute parisian ""no makeup"" makeup look, but I feel like that's not possible. 
Thanks for any tips in advance!!",2021-10-02 02:18:59

Yesterday I by accident disvovered this neat little eyeshadow at my local UD stand called ""Tonic"". I swatched it and was smitten immediately, but then I looked at the price - 23€ (that's 26$ atm folks) and I laughed and laughed and laughed all the way home.
Then I tried searching it online and I'm not laughing anymore. 

Are those UD duochromes really discontinued?? 
Is there still some place I can try and buy these online? Does this mean I'll have to grab it from my store while it can still be grabbed at all full (and jacked up euro tax) price be damned?

And lastly, do any of you perhaps know some good dupes for these before I go and murder my piggy bank for literally one single eyeshadow (or two)?

Makeup,HELP: How do you contour onto pale makeuo?,"Hello everyone in makeup, let me start off by saying I am an ABSOLUTE No0b when it comes to makeup, but I am wanting to seriously get into a specific look for my own personal interests, and I'm hoping to get as much advice + recommendation as possible.   


Now, I know the basics of contouring. I need to find makeup that matches my skin, which is pale with a lot of pink/red tones. I'm looking to generally go for that vampiric aesthetic, maybe not solid white, but definitely on the paler side. My question is though, for someone with a face between round/triangle, how would you contour onto pale makeup well? Do you use just a shade darker? Most goths just stick with Black or Grey, but if I were to aim to keep it more natural, what would be the best colours, and approach?  


I know about using a green to cover my face, but haha, I have the Hard Candy liquid Green and I think it does a kinda shit job prepping my face? I need a primer too, is Witchhazel fine until I get into the big leagues and buy a $40+ bottle?  


And while being greedy and desperately new, I would like to approach the vampiric look with some eye shadow. Now my eyes are a Grey/Green, and barely look blue until I wear a lot of black. I am a long haired ginger as well (I'll post a face pic to those who might need it for reference.) I want to maybe use Black/Green, for some gothic elegance, while still keeping that palid/dracula vibe.

I know about using a green to cover my face, but haha, I have the Hard Candy liquid Green and I think it does a kinda shit job prepping my face? I need a primer too, is Witch-hazel fine until I get into the big leagues and buy a $40+ bottle?

And while being greedy and desperately new, I would like to approach the vampiric look with some eye shadow. Now my eyes are a Grey/Green, and barely look blue until I wear a lot of black. I am a long haired ginger as well (I'll post a face pic to those who might need it for reference.) I want to maybe use Black/Green, for some gothic elegance, while still keeping that pallid/Dracula vibe.

Thanks in advance!!",2021-10-04 02:32:52

2. Hydraulic patches for acne. Best company to get these from? 
3. Lipstick colors for those with very (very 😔) pale white skin? I love red colors but it makes me look a little weird in contrast with my skin D:

Makeup,Light Olive Skin Foundation Help!!,"Hi everyone, I am needing some foundation recommendations for light olive skin. I am looking for a lightweight, natural, light/medium coverage foundation/tinted moisturizer. I will list the three products that somewhat work for me:

\- NYX Bare With Me Tinted Skin Veil in Vanilla Nude (This is the perfect shade match but I wish it had enough coverage to cover my acne scars)

\- Maybelline Fit Me Matte (The only foundation I use however I always mix it with some green primer to get that perfect shade match, if not then the foundation on its own is a smidge dark/orange on my skin)

\- Elf 16Hr Camo Concealer in Light Sand (Quite light when applying but oxidises once blended in skin however it is still a tad light)

I've tried so many foundations and I CAN'T for the life of me find a foundation that is a good match for me. I have combination skin leaning more towards oily hence if someone has a setting powder that works, please list it as well. Thank you!!",2021-10-04 08:32:48

Makeup,Sunscreen help,"I know I should have always been wearing sunscreen, but I confess I have not been. I’m 21F and very pale, but I don’t spend much time outdoors day-to-day (If I have plans to, I do put on sunscreen obviously). 

But recently I burned, bad, on my nose in less then 10 minutes. My new medication apparently makes me more susceptible to sun damage. So, I need a sunscreen recommendation- and I’m unfortunately picky… please help! Here’s the issues I’ve had with sunscreens in the past.

1. I don’t wear makeup daily, so a foundation based sunscreen is out
2. I have quite sensitive skin, and some sunscreens have caused reactions.
3. Another medication I take causes heat sensitivity, so I sweat a lot- especially on my face. This is made worse by heavy sunscreen that doesn’t let my skin breathe. That means Ive sweat off the sunscreens I have tried. 

I swear I’m genuinely trying to get help with this, my skin is a gremlin that is impossible to please. I don’t want skin cancer. However, I have to be firm on not wearing makeup daily, not because I don’t want to, but becuase it’s not permitted in some of the rooms in my work for safety reasons. In this particular chemical lab, our faces are supposed to be clear of anything that is not PPE. We also are a testing laboratory, so the rule is also to avoid contamination of any kind. Yes the rules are frequently bent (try to prove someone’s wearing mascara without grabbing their eye) but foundation is just not a feasible option for me each day. Any other suggestions welcome!

Makeup,Maybelline Matte Ink - what am I doing wrong?!,"So after reading a lot about this liquid lipstick and everyone and their mother falling over themselves to sing its praises and how it won't come off no matter what, I bit the bullet when it was on sale last week. 

It's very disappointing so far. After making a total mess the first few times I applied it, I finally got that part down but... Eating, drinking, kissing... It just comes right off, smudges all around my mouth, I leave stains on everything and everyone. It's terrible. I do use lots of lip balm but having read the instructions of this lipstick, I remove everything from my lips before application to make sure my lips are as dry a canvas as possible so the product can adhere to them. But no matter how much or little product I use, it stays sticky for quite a bit and never seems to fully dry. I blot and set with powder and don't do anything to my lips for hours after application but first time my lips touch anything, it'll be ruined immediately. 

Am I doing something wrong? Why doesn't it budge for everyone but me?!",2021-10-04 19:11:43

But I do, so I'm getting a ginger wig that doesn't have bangs and I wanted to use a ginger eyeliner pencil to draw on lighter eyebrows.

Now I tend to rely mostly on nudes/browns/pinks and while I like it, and it’s pretty, I feel sort of…boring! I have some eyeshadow pallets with fun and bright colors, but it’s like I’m scared or nervous to use them. I worry I am going to look like a clown. It’s like I’ve forgotten how to do my own makeup. Especially within the last few years, since I became a mom and since the pandemic started. I don’t go out much, but when I do I rely on the same safe look. Plus, as I’ve gotten older, I feel like I have developed a bit of a hood over my eyes which has also changed the way I apply my makeup. 

I guess I’m wondering what some good resources are for tutorials specifically geared towards colorful makeup! Greens, blues, purples, you name it! I want to spice it up. I want to feel like myself again.

Makeup,ABH Brow Pencil Dupe From a Picky Gal,"So I've been a ride or die fan of the Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Pencil for quite some time. I love the depth of the color, longevity, and the consistency.

A few years ago I went on a mission trying to find drugstore dupes and found that they never worked as well as ABH. I have slightly oily skin and my brows are really dark compared to the hair on my head (blonde), so it was kind of a pain trying so many. I read so many reviews, watched so many YouTube videos... and no dice.

Well, fast forward to the other day -- I randomly grabbed a brow pencil in Target thinking I haven't searched for a dupe in a while. Didn't read reviews, guessed on the color, thought it was cheap ($7-$8) and didn't think much of it. Lo and behold, IT FREAKING WORKS. It's creamy yet long lasting, the color is beauuuutiful, and the price is 1/3 of ABH! It's called L'Oreal Paris Brow Stylist Definer Eyebrow Mechanical Pencil.

Just wanted to put this out there in case any other oily or picky ABH fans haven't yet found a dupe that actually works!",2021-08-29 07:14:51

I've been having problems lately with my eyeshadow creasing on my eyelids. I go to work and several hours later realize my eye makeup has completely deteriorated and I look a little crazy (my job involves moving furniture and with the hot weather lately I've been sweating more). I looked in the history here and saw a couple of posts recommending primer and setting spray, some brand specific, but I'm wondering if it has to be a primer specific to eyes?

I subscribed to Ipsy until very recently and have a few face primers that I haven't tried yet, but I'm not super sure what the difference is. My makeup routine is simple and quick - eyes only - I'm an 'out the door fifteen minutes after I wake up' type!

Makeup,Any skincare products to get rid of acne?,"Hello! I know that many of you have faced problems such as acne. Perhaps, some of you are still fighting with acne and post-acne scars despite no longer being teens. Maybe someone has already obtained a victory in this battle and can share some beauty tips. It would be interesting to find out which products you’ve tried already and can recommend to the rest?

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I cannot say that I have got rid of all the imperfections. I still do have blemishes from time to time. However, I found some products that can help me more or less.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If we talk about brands such as Clinique, Kiehl’s, and Garnier. I’m not gonna waste your time and talk about those brands. The only thing I would like to mention is that they are 100% effective, at least for me. Maybe you have noticed the same thing. That’s why I want to talk about the products you have tried already and saw some positive improvements in your skin? 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you can also suggest some masks, scrubs, or serums? For instance, my friend recently recommended me a watermelon sleeping glow mask. I’ve checked some reviews online, and it says that it also helps the prone to acne skin and even helps to get rid of post-acne scars. But, I’m the type of person who wants to double-check all the reviews and ask for more feedback about specific products before I buy them and put them on my face or body. Besides, I’m not a big fan of sleeping masks, but if it’s really gonna help me, I will put it all over my face.

So, I hope that this topic will be helpful for those who have acne problems at any age, and everyone can suggest some products and share their feedback.",2021-09-01 19:50:54

I read a few post regarding tattoo/scar coverage topic, but some of the language is foreign to me because I’m a guy haha. What I understood is I need a concealer, setting power with talc in it, and a setting spray. 

Dermablend as a concealer; Ben Nye as the setting powder with talc; and Huda Beauty setting spray comes up a lot as recommended products. 

I hope I did okay with understanding some of the basics of coverage application, and was hoping members can elaborate with additional  product recommendations, techniques, tools, video, etc. 

My goals is to find products that won’t stick on my collar shirts, sweat proof, long coverage without reapplying (an 8 hour work day), and water resistance. 

Thank you for all your help!",2021-09-03 05:01:25
Makeup,Reapplying Makeup?,"Hey pals,

I am fairly new to makeup which means I sometimes forget to apply setting spray - which means my makeup wears off over the course of the day! I don’t wear a ton of make up on my skin  (tinted moisturizer and cream blush).

But when this happens, how do you recommend I reapply? I’ve just kind of carefully reapplying the product where it’s worn off and then setting it? Any other ideas?

Thanks!",2021-09-03 09:19:18
Makeup,Long lasting makeup,"Hey, I’m going to a Viking wedding on Saturday. I am looking for the best long lasting black lipstick. I am kinda on a budget so I was gonna try the Sephora brand.

Not sure if that would be good to draw on face with or not. Just curious. 🖤",2021-09-03 09:49:35
Makeup,A more... theatrical make-up question,"So, my partner and I were talking, and now we're having plans to go as Hades and Persephone for Halloween. We have a neat idea of how we want him to look, which is like his skin is a shell hiding an almost obsidian or brimstone look underneath and thinking about it, I've run into a conundrum. I can't think of any way to make something that we could put on his skin, and tear a hole in to make it look like his skin was peeled back, while still allowing a way to draw a vein design on his arms.

Anyone that is skilled in more theatrical kinds of makeup effects, any recommendations for different things I can use? Preferably cheap options, as I'm a minimum wage teenager with bad spending habits, LOL!

Thank you in advance and have a nice day/night!",2021-09-03 10:06:58

Makeup,How do I make my white eyeshadow stay put?,"I've started dressing vintage this year (mainly 60s style) and I'm still working on a good vintage makeup look. After a lot of observation, I've noticed that a lot of 60s looks that I love use white eyeshadow. I'm very, VERY pale, so I have to use the whitest shade available, but everytime I apply it, it dissapears almost immediately, even with setting spray. 
What can I do to make sure it stays on? Is there some kind of cream or something I can use? 

Thank you in advance if you respond! I will take some time to get back to you as I'm posting this right before bed 💕🌼",2021-09-05 14:38:53

Makeup,Go to look for an office job,"Hi, fellow makeup lovers! 

I am going back to an old company I used to work at and am searching for a more mature go-to makeup look. I used to work/intern at this place from the ages of 17 - 19 (am 26 now)  but now that I will be joining as a full-time employee, I am hoping to adopt a look that screams professional! I do have some ideas of what I want to do but I thought maybe I'd ask here too, since this community is so helpful and always bustling with new makeup insights and ideas.  

My former look when I interned was: - a full face of bb-cream (I did not discover foundation or concealer yet) + winged black eye-liner and 1 coat of mascara + bare eyebrows (I did not know how to fill/draw them in yet and my brows are quite dense anyways)+ purple lipstick (was going through a phase and they did not seem to care much since I was just an intern). 

Please help a girl out. Thanks everyone!! :)",2021-09-05 17:58:55

Makeup,Help - Replacement for BECCA Ultimate Coverage 24 Hour Foundation???,"I’ve been using the same BECCA Ultimate Coverage 24 Hour Foundation in the color “maple” (formerly “tobacco”) for the past 7 years, and I am devastated that they are closing down the brand. I’ve never been able to find a color match as close to my skin as this foundation (which still wasn’t 100% perfect) and with my acne-prone skin it’s been the best unscented foundation I could find that offers coverage without causing more acne. Does anyone have any recommendations for a brand that has a similar foundation? I never used a ton (only two tiny pumps blended in) so I’m open to lighter formulas if it still gets the job done. I tried YouTube and asking a rep at Ulta but recommendations have been all over the place and don’t match me at all (Fenty and Dermablend - both too orange). Even tried IL Makiage but the foundation match was wayyy off, it was too watery and it gave me a reaction. Would appreciate any recommendations as I’m officially out of foundation :(",2021-09-05 23:57:48

It feels like I'm wearing nothing, but has amazing coverage and is super buildable. Also it looks flawless at the end of a busy workday.

Makeup,Hydrating lip balm recommendations,"I’ve tried lanegie lip sleeping mask, carmex, Vaseline, rose-hip oil, A&amp;D, burts beers, EOS(I hate), Nivea, chapstick(brand), tonymoly, and some others.

Personally the only two that I like from that list is Burts Bees and Nivea. I’d say they work half of how I want them to. All the other ones dont leave my lips soft and moisturized. Sure they’ll look shiny but they get dry again after an hour. Burrs bees and Nivea I’ll have to put on multiple times like the others but they kind of moisturizer my lips, kind of. I live in a desert so and our humidity levels are typically VERY LOW. Today it’s 8%. I’m looking for a lip balm that is essential a glass of water for my dehydrated lips. I’d like to add, humectants don’t work for me where I live and dry the hell out of my skin. They only work for me when I visit a humid place. I drink at a minimum 32oz water everyday. I usually end up drinking 48-64 oz. I read once that nipple cream is hydrating for lips since they’re the same type of skin, but I haven’t tried that yet.",2021-09-06 07:21:28

Makeup,Pale olive foundations,"I LOVE the CC+ Cream with SPF 50+. I used it years ago and haven’t bought it since, but it made my skin better. The only down side is it oxidized and would turn an orangey brown tint. I saw on ultras website mixing pigments for foundation. The pigments come in dark blue, yellow, orange, and white. The shade I originally got of the IT foundation was ‘light’ which is described as having “W/ warm yellow undertone”

I’d like to buy fair since I’m fair in the winter and would fit light in the summer since I tan. I’m not sure how to mix colors with foundations and how I would for summer vs winter. For reference, during summer my skin looks pretty light tan olive, but during winter I can look kinda dead almost grey??? If I get fair, how could I make it a little bit darker for summer to match my skin, but still have olive undertone?",2021-09-06 08:06:09

Makeup,Help with Recovery after Buying/Using Expired Makeup,"I'm pretty new to using makeup. This week I got a bit of extra cash and decided to treat myself to a little haul of the lipstick and lip gloss from local beauty shops. (Just the shades I though might be a good everyday color. Didn't find it, btw but found other cute shades)

Three of the never-opened lipsticks I bought yesterday smelled like crayon and didn't have much color payoff. I figured it was because they were cheap. Later, I found out this means they're expired!

I washed my lips really well and put on some Carmex before I went to bed last night. This morning lips still felt dry and sensitive.

Is there anything else I should be doing in addition to or in place of using Carmex to heal my lips? I figured this wouldn't heal overnight, but I want to know the best thing to do and not just wing it and find that I did something else wrong.

Other than the crayon smells, are there other smells or things I should look out for before trying new makeup?

Thank you for your time.",2021-09-06 20:34:00

99% of lipsticks makes me look like an old woman (I'm 25) there's one that's kinda like my skin tone but a little darker which looks OK at first but quickly looks nasty and dry, lip gloss makes everything 10x worst. (My lips are kind of on the thin side if that mean anything).

I'm okish with eye shadow on the lids of my eyes, can't get in underneath without looking ridiculous, not brave enough to try anything besides natural/neutral colors.

I tried blush for the first time today and I think it looked OK so I'll probably add it to my usual routine.

So far, the em cosmetics serum blush hasn’t disturbed powder foundation but it can stick to my hair. I also think I tried a canmake cream blush years ago and I don’t think it moved the products underneath either.

🛍 New Makeup Releases ... Inspired or Tired? 🧹

......

➡️ NOTE: This is MY opinion &amp; experience; regarding the product quality (I'm not trying to offend anybody's specific product taste). As always, use/buy the makeup that makes YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun.

......

This is just window-shopping the new beauty releases (one of my favorite things to do!) Sometimes, I come across some really awesome, inspiring products - other times, I feel some type of way about a few of these releases. Read on to find out if I'm 'Inspired or Tired' by these 9 new products! 


Inspired = possibly going on my wishlist 


Tired = why?

......

▪️Haus Laboratories 'Le Monster' Lip Vault Vol. 2 - $170.00 


➡️ Classification: High-End Makeup 


❌ TIRED 


☕ I frequently check several brand websites for new releases, &amp; every time I check Haus Laboratories - they are releasing a monstrous vault with an extremely high price tag. Barely ever do I find new formulas, just the same thing repackaged to suit a higher volume of product. I get that there are collectors out there, but the sheer amount of collectible vaults that this brand releases is impractical. 

......

▪️Bechy Beauty Blends x Mystical Glamour 'Deities' Single Eyeshadows - $7.55/each 


➡️ Classification: Indie Makeup 


✅ INSPIRED 


☕ Just looking at the picture, I like EVERY single shade. Indie brands know how to do a VERY good eyeshadow. I've never tried anything from this brand before, but I love this collaboration, &amp; I'd love to add some of these singles to my collection. Plus the price of them is very much on par with similar quality shades from other brands. 

......

▪️Essence Makeup 'Brow Wax' Pen - $2.99 


➡️ Classification: Affordable Makeup 


❌ TIRED 


☕ I couldn't tell you how many times I've tried a wax pencil, &amp; the product was just simply a fail. I look for waxes to completely change the direction of my brow hairs, &amp; anything that is pliable enough for 'stick' form isn't as strong as I need it to be. The pencil also looks quite 'short', &amp; I'd assume one would go through this product extremely quickly.

......

▪️Glossier 'Solar Paint' Luminous Bronzer Crème - $20.00 


➡️ Classification: High-End Makeup 


✅ INSPIRED 


☕ These just look cool. I love a luminous bronzer, so I'm not one to shy away from that aspect. I've tried very minimal product from Glossier, so if I were to ever place an order with them - this is definitely a stand-out product that calls for my attention.

......

▪️Flower Beauty 'Red Carpet Secret Eye Bright' Palette - $14 


➡️ Classification: Affordable Makeup 


❌ TIRED 


☕ Everything about this just makes me dislike it ... especially the obnoxiously sizable price tag. I think the applicator would be terrible to apply a firmer cream product, &amp; even considering blending it out with that thing seems impossible. The amount of setting powder you get is quite insufficient granted how much under-eye powder I actually use. 

......

▪️VDL 'Perfecting Last' Foundation - $20.10 


➡️ Classification: K-Beauty Makeup 


✅ INSPIRED 


☕ I've tried a lot of K-Beauty makeup, &amp; this brand is definitely amongst my favorite! Their products are so luxurious, it's inexplicable as to how they keep their prices so low. When I saw that they were releasing a new foundation, I was very excited! They use some absolute ground-breaking technologies in their products to really set the standard bar high. I can only imagine how much I would enjoy this product, &amp; I hope to add it to my collection one day!

▪️Violet Voss 'Care Bears' Eyeshadow  Palette - $? 


➡️ Classification: High-End Makeup 


❌ TIRED 


☕ I've nothing against 'Care Bears' &amp; I actually think it makes a cute palette theme. My only bother with THIS palette, is that the interior color-story isn't really reminiscent of what one would expect by glancing at the palette's cover. Inside, it looks just like any other of Violet Voss's million rainbow eyeshadow palettes, &amp; definitely not suggestive to that of 'Care Bears'. There's just nothing exclusive to this palette that makes me want to buy it.

▪️Too Faced 'Pomade in a Pencil' Brow Pencil - $23.00
 

➡️ Classification: High-End Makeup 


✅ INSPIRED 


☕ I've really been loving triangle-shaped brow pencils lately, &amp; the fact that this one is crafted of 'pomade' sounds captivating. I usually use both a pencil AND a pomade in my brows, so I wonder if this product would be a viable solution for me? I also wonder if it would be TOO soft &amp; creamy to shape any precision lines. So many questions, but I'd definitely give it a shot!

▪️Morphe '35F Fall Into Fabulous' Artistry Palette - $26.00 


➡️ Classification: Affordable Makeup 


❌ TIRED 


☕ Sometimes Morphe has really remarkable palettes that stand-out in an industry bogged down by palettes. However, this one just doesn't do it for me. It looks to have too many repetitive shades, &amp; I honestly believe it would make a great 9-pan. I'm sure the formula is nice, &amp; you can get a good many looks out of it - but it's unarguably NOT for me.

Makeup,How to Clean Out a Lip Gloss Tube?,"Hello,

I have a couple of the old Urban Decay Pocket Rocket lip glosses from 2010. I would like to empty them of old product and put in a new lip gloss to use, as the packaging on these are cute. Is that possible? Any tips on how to empty them without destroying the component? Tips?

Makeup,Any tips for under eye concealer for someone with red/pink cheeks?,"After years of playing with makeup, I’ve decided foundation isn’t for me. Especially after moving to the desert. I really want to find a brightening concealer that’s 70%ish coverage though to make me look a little more polished. I can’t find a good shade match though because I have red/pink cheeks that I’m not looking to cover up. Any advice or product recommendations? Or will I not be able to conceal just my under eye without messing with my cheeks? Also, I have no idea my undertone, sometimes I see yellowish and sometimes I see pink.",2021-07-30 12:27:44
Makeup,I'm just kinda getting into make up and I'm looking for affordable decent brands I can experiment with (preferably lip gloss/eyeliner),I think my title sums it up. I don't do much mostly because u don't know how yet so just some nice lip glosses/liquid lipstick and eyeliner I can experiment with that's well relatively pigmented but if I mess up isn't to big a deal cost wise.... I like fun colors!! Like blues and purples but also want a few standard options as well I think I prefer more mat finish from what I've seen thus far but gloss is fun too,2021-07-30 14:11:47

Makeup,What are your shopping habits?,"Hey lovelies, I have a question for everybody: Which kind of store do you usually find yourself choosing when shopping for a makeup product/products?

1. The one where the price of the product is lower than in other shops, but you pay for shipping, OR
2. The one where the product is slightly more pricey but the store offers free shipping?",2021-07-31 00:19:22
Makeup,Allergic reaction to a Tower 28 lip gloss ?,"I'd like to talk about something weird that happened today : I tried a Tower 28 lip gloss for the first time, and within seconds my lips felt numb, and I had a sensation of pins and needles, especially on my upper lip. 

The sensation went from ""wait, was this supposed to be plumping ?"" about a minute in, to not being able to talk properly, and needing to get this off my lips ASAP because it hurts, just 30ish secs later. After removing it, the numbness slowly faded, to be back to my normal sensations about 15mins later. I didn't see any swelling.

I'm confused because this type of reaction never happened to me before, I have no issues with my other lip glosses (at worst, I felt a slight tingling with the Fenty gloss bomb, and stopped using it). Plus the brand insists on their products being hypoallergenic, suited for sensitive skin, so I wasn't worried about allergens. I'm surprised at how intense my reaction was (and I'm on antihistamines, this is bizarre but I can't find another explanation than an allergy). I patch tested it on my had and in my elbow crease, nothing happened.

I looked up what could cause lip numbness but haven't found anything of note that could explain why the gloss did this. I compared Tower 28's formula composition to all the other glosses I've tried and had no issues with (Clarins, Roen, Pat McGrath, Lisa Eldridge, Too Faced, Urban Decay), and all I could identify as being different were the vegetal oils (apricot kernel oil, rice bran extract, rosemary leaf extract, rosa canina fruit oil, raspberry seed oil).

Has anyone had experienced a similar reaction, or have any insight on this ? I don't know what to think of this problem.",2021-07-31 00:48:49

Makeup,Foundation Issues,"So I’m not big into makeup, my mom made me feel scandalous for wanting to wear it for school and did it for me if there was q formal event saying I had to wear it and would look bad without it so I never learned and now I just don’t have the patience. I do however wear a little bit here and there mostly foundation, lipstick, basic eyeliner, and mascara. 

My main issue is in foundation right now. I splurged a bit and bought NARS since it’s supposed to be good for dry skin and got it color matched at Ulta and everything but it’s too full coverage and ends up making me look fake and sickly since i don’t know how to contour or use blush. I started mixing it with a moisturizer to make it more sheer since it allows my natural red pigmentation to show and gives my face dimension but it starts like cracking and looking flakey despite being a liquid foundation. I use a primer and everything!

Should I try mixing it with something else or do I just need to cut my losses and try to find a new foundation with more buildable coverage? For reference the shade is mont blanc I have very dry skin except for my nose which is oily and I’m very red in the face.

Any help would be appreciated!!!",2021-07-31 07:11:28

Makeup,"Monthly Favorites - July, 2021 • Reviews","[Pictures of each product are on my profile, if interested!]

🏅 July - 2021 Favorites! 🗓

......

➡️ NOTE: This is MY opinion &amp; experience; regarding the product quality. As always, use/buy the makeup that makes YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun.

......

This is a curated list (with reviews!) of my six most-loved, tried-and-true products from the month of July. 


Over the last month, I found myself repeatedly returning to these products, &amp; I wanted to share them with you!

......

📌 Touch in Sol 'Pretty Filter' Glassy Skin Balm 


▪️ Why: I ALWAYS double-prime, &amp; for my first primer I tend to go with either a hydrating or illuminating formula. This one is a SUPERIOR hydrator. It feels sooo nice as I apply it to my face, that I actually crave putting this product on. It feels the best hydrating the under-eye area, &amp; you can feel an immediate difference in the texture of your skin. There is a slight fragrance to this, but I really like it &amp; find it refreshing. The cream itself is very soft, &amp; almost gel-like in texture.


💰 Price: $32 (Ulta)

......

📌 Physician's Formula 'Butter Believe It!' Foundation + Concealer 


▪️ Why: I choose three foundations each month to use, &amp; NEVER would I have thought THIS would be the one that I liked so much! I love how it completely transforms my face &amp; covers up everything that I don't want to see - without feeling heavy or gross. Another benefit to this formula is that it doesn't BUDGE. It's very difficult to take off at the end of the day, which I kind of appreciate because it stays in place all day long. I love that it doubles as a concealer, so I get that demanded extra-coverage exactly where I need it. Also, this does have a strong tropical fragrance to it, but I don't mind it. It works extremely well with both a brush AND a dampened sponge. 


🕶 Shade: Light-to-Medium

💰 Price: $11.99 (Ulta)

......

📌 No7 'Lift &amp; Luminate Triple Action' Finishing Powder
 

▪️ Why: I ran out of my beloved Charlotte Tilbury mini powder, &amp; I've always heard that this was a dupe product for that finishing powder. Well, I even like it MORE than the Charlotte Tilbury! Just a fine layer of powder gently pressed under the eye creates an absolute blurred section. I was incredibly impressed the first time I used it, &amp; I couldn't believe the price difference! This finishing powder is an ABSOLUTE must-have in any makeup lover's collection. 


🕶 Shade: Light/Medium

💰 Price: $10.77 (Amazon)

......

📌 Charlotte Tilbury Brow Set - 'Brow Cheat' Micro Precision Brow Pencil &amp; 'Legendary Brows' Micro Precision Tinted Brow Gel 


▪️ Why: I just love everything about this duo. Together, these pieces create my perfect brow. The pencil is the PERFECT consistency, &amp; it's so easy to use as well as being comfortable in the hand. The shade is exactly what I look for in a brow pencil. I am able to create bold lines as well as simple strokes with the one unique tip. The brow gel, on-the-other-hand is the perfect set to my shape. The teensy brush allows me to get in between each brow hair &amp; shape them precisely where I want them. The color isn't overpowering, either. It's just enough to provide a slight ombre effect. If you are really into brows like me, you'd really enjoy this set! 


🕶 Shade: Pencil = Natural Brown; Gel = Soft Brown

💰 Price: Duo = $48; Pencil = $25 ; Gel = $23

......

📌 Lip Duo - Lottie London 'Slay All Day' Lipliner &amp; Tower28 'ShineOn' Lip Jelly 


▪️ Why: I always try new lip combinations every month, &amp; this was my find this month!! I love how this set creates the most-natural FULL, juicy lips - yet, it's so easy &amp; unchallenging. I use the pencil to line &amp; define only my cupid's bow area &amp; a small, bold line below my lower lip to create the illusion of fuller lips. The jelly gloss shade goes PERFECTLY with the lip liner shade &amp; really camouflages the application lines. I get a nice, solid wear time out of this combo, too! 


🕶 Shade: Pencil = Fleek; Gloss = Coconut

💰 Price: Duo = $19; Pencil = $5 ; Gloss = $14

......

📌 Roma Laundry Detergent 


▪️ Why: I secretly enjoy doing laundry because I'm addicted to fragrant things - &amp; laundry is one of those areas where you can really discover some pretty interesting scents. I've always had my eye on this detergent, &amp; wondered how a $1 detergent would perform...&amp; well, it actually SHOCKED me. I am a dedicated powder-Tide person, &amp; I would choose this any day over powdered-Tide. It smells soooo good, &amp; cleans so well. I'm really happy I tested this hidden gem out. 


💰 Price: $1.12 (Walmart)

Makeup,Lit from within natural highlighter - Sephora credit to use,"Hello. Can anyone recommend a lit from within, natural highlighter (no glitter/obvious shimmer) that would work on textured skin. I just want to keep it very subtle for personal preference. I’m going to have a $90+ dollar in store credit at Sephora to use because I forgot to return some items within 30 days. 

I’ve heard Nars may have something like this, but I find their blushes like orgasm to have too much glow. Not sure where to even begin. Alternately I’d be willing to try something drugstore just to dry out the look and use my credit on some dermalogica product or a few blurring powders I’ve been wanting to try. 

PS. Please no Hourglass. Their baked and ambient powders have emphasized my pores in the past and I’m not willing to try their brand anymore in general. 

Thanks!!",2021-07-31 11:58:56
Makeup,Makeup/No-Makeup look with skin hyperpigmentation?,"I have hyperpigmentation on my chin area. I would really like to know a good concealer that would give that no-makeup look finish. I don’t like wearing foundation, so a good concealer would be a must for me.

I would prefer a cream based concealer. But I’m not sure if a liquid would be best? Would I need like a primer or something else with it to make it stay? I don’t wear makeup usually so I wouldn’t know. I have oily skin by the end of the day btw.",2021-07-31 14:19:31
Makeup,30-something M trying to cover beard shadow; can I get some feedback/advice?,"Hi all! Probably not a surprise but I'm a still-figuring-it-out-gender-wise AMAB who has been feuding with my beard shadow, and I feel like I could use some help from people who know what they are talking about. My beard is dark, rough, and pervasive, and I have extremely oily skin. I've tried a number of things, but I feel like I'm still at auto-clocked status even to myself which makes me \*super\* dysphoric. I'm also a total newbie to makeup for the most part and am kind of having to learn it out as I go.

My current routine: 

* Shave
* Moisturizer
* Face primer (Rimmel Stay Matte)
* Corrector over mustache/goatee area (LA Girl Peach Corrector), set with powder
* Concealer (Maybelline Fit Me) over the corrected area, set with powder
* Foundation (Maybelline Fit Me Matte + Poreless) over face, including corrected/concealed area

Am I going wrong on technique? Do I need different products for my face? How much of this is in my head vs . . .well, my face? 

I've put a few pictures into an Imgur album (multiple days, angles, lighting) for your consideration: [https://theprincessunknown.imgur.com/all](https://theprincessunknown.imgur.com/all).

Is it okay to still use? I would hate to have to throw everything out as some of the items were barely used. 

I looked at everything and nothing seemed to be wrong but one of of my Mac lipsticks, there was a film on the bottom when I rolled it up all the way.

Makeup,Inkwell liquid eyeliner suggestions?,"NYX discontinued my holy grail Vinyl liquid eyeliner, so I need some inkwell eyeliner recommendations!

The reason why I prefer liquid eyeliners in inkwell packaging over ones in pen or marker packaging, is because I had a NYX Epic Ink eyeliner, Physician Formula Eye Booster, Milani the Tank eyeliner, and Maybelline Curvitude eyeliner run out after 2 weeks. Yes, all four of then happen to dry out after 2 weeks each (weird). Whereas, inkwell eyeliners lasts months and even years for me. I also find them more easier to apply too.

Makeup,Foundation/ Tinted moisturiser,Hey!! I was after some suggestions for foundations or tinted moisturisers for super dry and sensitive skin. My skin is mostly clear but my cheeks get red pretty easily. I am currently using the nars radiant tinted moisturisers but want something with a little but more coverage and longer lasting. Any suggestions would be nice. Thank you ☺️,2021-08-01 20:54:04

Makeup,No matter how much makeup I wear I feel as though it doesn’t cover up my hyperpigmentation,"I have around a tan/honey/caramel skin colour. I have a lot of textured bumps on my forehead and acne scarring. 

I use concealer / orange colour corrector / foundation to even out the scarring with my face where it’s more clearer around the cheeks and chin. 

However, despite this I feel as though I am looking at two different coverages. One where my forehead is more darker than the rest of my face. 

Does anyone know how to tackle this?",2021-08-01 23:39:02

Ulta:

            curious to see if they could apply even more beautifully than they
            already do. 
• Mac Prep + Prime Fix+ Primer &amp; Setting Spray: I've heard so many
            people absolutely love this, and I trust most Mac products, so I'm
            real curious about it. 
• Colourpop Pretty Fresh Setting Mist: my current go-to setting spray,
            about to run out.
• Colourpop Pretty Fresh Concealer in 40N: my current go-to concealer,
            about to expire/run out.

            this, I like their Clump Crusher but I need some volume so
            interested in trying.

            flattering on her. Love her. 

Sephora:
• Kosas Cloud Set Powder in Airy: Julia Adams &amp; Jamie Paige rave
            about this powder and I really trust their judgment. I'm over loose
            setting powders, this product sounds so perfect.
• Makeup by Mario Brightening Eye Pencil: I love a nude waterline and
            have been so disappointed in Colourpop's creme gel eyeliners.
            I've bought 2 of the nude shade because I thought the first might
            have been a dud and turns out that they just suck on me lol
• Huda Beauty Microshade Brow Pencil in Soft Black: love how thin this
            pencil is, I need to buy a pencil and colourpop is always sold out.

            be so flattering.

            about this concealer. However, I'm concerned about my
            recommend shade as I have a neutral/cool undertone, but
            findation suggests this 03W. Plus I'm worried this expires way
            too quickly since it's clean makeup.

           formulas in beautiful shades. I'm so fond of lip tints and really

           versions. Heard they're 10x better.
• I'm Meme I'm Multi Cube in All About Apple Red: IN LOVE with mini,
           multifunction makeup. This looks beautiful for everyday. 

Elsewhere:
• About-Face Beauty Lil Duo in Nudist Judas + Clockwork: Looks like
           the most beautiful yellow brown lip combo, kind of reminiscence
           of a 90s lip. Could even look great with the Fenty Beauty Cream
           Gloss Bomb in Honey Waffles.

           matte top coat. I've tried so many drugstore ones in the past and
           always had issues. This looks legit. I need more Holo in my life so
           I should finally try a top coat from the #1 Holo enthusiast.

Truly Wishing for a Comeback:
• Melt Cosmetics VIDA palette: literally the only colorful palette I will
            ever need in my life. Such a dream of a palette. The most perfect,
            true red I've ever seen. Seen it swatched like butter. Love the 
            greens. Has the one perfect yellow. Such a fan of neutral tone
            nudes in the palette as well. The shimmers looks as amazing as 
            the mattes. Love the theme as I am hispanic. It's like the perfect
            mango inspired palette, which is also my favorite fruit.",2021-08-02 02:10:19

Makeup,I'm a fifteen year old girl and I need help with my foundation.,"I've been using makeup for about a year now and thanks to face masks, I've had a little bit of room for expirementation but with the new school year coming up and the possibility of no masks, I find myself stuck in a corner.

No matter what i do, my foundation doesn't cover up my blemishes. I tried both powder and liquid, brush and fingers. I am currently using a medium to full coverage liquid foundation that is mostly working. The problem is that as soon as I step out of my bathroom and into the sunlight, it's almost as if my foundation isn't there. The sun shows the truth: that my foundation is not working. My pimples, which aren't terrible but still prominent, show, along with my freckles, which I'm not to worried about, dark spots on my face, and my huge pores. Of course concealer helps but there is only so much that it can do. I've tried going super light (maybe it just didn't look natural with too much makeup) and I've tried putting on multiple layers. My skin is often oily so I use a mattifying primer. It is silicon based while my foundation is water based so I tried using a different primer but I get the same thing. No matter what I do, when I look at my mirror near my window, it's just terrible.

My skin isn't the best, although I've recently begun taking bigger steps to fix that. I moisturize, exfoliate, etc, but I am a teen and I don't have the ""perfect skin"" gene. The fact is that I've seen the way that foundation can cover up imperfections and I can't figure out how to do it for myself.

Is it just that the foundation isn't right for my skin? Or is there a different application that I haven't tried? Thanks for reading and I hope that someone can help.",2021-08-02 02:47:06

Makeup,I got my new palette in the mail yesterday and it has like no pigment at all!!,"I recieved the ""In a Trance"" Colourpop palette in the mail yesterday. I was super excited cause this is the first colorful palette I've ever bought (I usually stick to rosey tones or neutral tones for eyeshadow). I did the patch test on my arm (I have a very pale skin tone so usually any shade types will show up on me pretty well), and I could barely see any of the colors at all. They also faded away within like 20 mins of being on my arm without any activity happening.

Is there anything I can do to make the pigment better without applying so many layers my skin gets irritated? I have 3 other Colourpop palettes that I've had little to no issue with. I know some of their colors aren't pigmented sometimes, but its never been an entire palette of 9 so this kinda sucks and I was super excited to use it ://",2021-08-02 05:12:58

Makeup,Mascara keeps leaving black smudges underneath eyes,"Hello! I need some advice on what to do with my mascara. At the end of the day when I want to wash my face after the day is up I'll notice black smudges almost underneath my eye. It almost looks like a black eye or something or like I had put black shadow under my eye. I don't normally rub my eyes, so I figured it was caused by my mascara being on my lower lash line. 

Today I didnt put any mascara on my lower lash line and still ended up with the smudges. It's basically on the portion where I'd put my concealer on my eye bags, so if I try and wipe it off I just would end up removing my concealer.

Has anyone had this happen before? It's obviously not caused by the lower lash line now so I'm kinda lost on how to fix this. Am I blinking too much or something??

For reference, I use the Benefit Roller Lash mascara. Any advice would be helpful!! Thank you!",2021-08-02 09:47:55

Makeup,please help with my foundation 😭,"
hi 💖 i’m just looking for some advice &amp; tips on foundation products &amp; application. i get pretty mild-moderate acne but have fairly bad acne scarring so full coverage is a must i also have oily skin and all foundations i use seem to always separate (the worst is probably on my nose and my cheeks). 

i avoid doing any skin care or moisturising before applying the foundation because it has seemed to make it worse and instead just wash my face with water 

i’m currently using the Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Pro Filt'R Mattifying Primer, Too Faced Born This Way foundation and the Laura Mercier Loose Setting Powder

What am I doing wrong 😩 
also what is the best setting spray? I use just a morphe x jeffree star one and not really fan of that at all

There aren’t any other factors affecting my skin right now either- I love makeup but I don’t wear it everyday and it’s never made my skin worse. I also don’t really have a skincare routine and I’m not on birth control either so this is pretty much my skins natural state. I also have sensitive skin and have had reactions to certain sunscreens and on one notable occasion, chapstick.

Makeup,Starting Makeup at 27 [Makeup Help],"Hey everyone,  
I'm just now learning how to wear makeup at 27. Growing up I was never into makeup- I wore it to prom, to graduation, to job interviews, but literally that was it. It was both just a hassle and I was definitely one of ""those girls"" who thought makeup was ""hiding your true self"" or some other backwards thinking.   
Now I want to catch up and explore what I've been missing out on. From normal people on the street to you-tubers, makeup just seems so magical and really seems to elevate people's self esteem and mood.   
But I'm not 13 anymore and I don't really have the social permission to mess up my makeup and play around. If I come to work looking like a 6 year old loose in mom's lipstick, it hits a lot harder at this age.   


I took a minute to research and find out I'm a pink/blue undertone (different people call it different things?) and what colors work well with that as an introductory.  


I figured a BB cream or sheer foundation/sunscreen combo would be best for me to start with, so I got a bottle of Loreal's Infallible foundation in Cool Porcelain. I also grabbed a Burts Bees brown mascara and I already had a bottle of Lush's brown liquid eyeliner that I really like.   


I got in front of my bathroom mirror and tried my best. I feel like I look like Leatherface. Especially without my glasses, my face in the mirror looks alien. Inhuman. My partner says I look fine. Is this something I'll get over? Is looking at yourself in makeup and seeing YOU a skill you have to build? Or am I just doing something wrong? I don't think I'm putting on too much, but maybe not having blush is doing it?  


I appreciate any and all advice, and thank you for reading!",2021-08-03 00:17:24

Makeup,false lashes coming off - due to glasses?,"Hi all, I saw that there was one other post on here about lashes and glasses (the advice was to trim them and wear them) but I have a bit of a different dilemma. 

I went to a makeup trial last week (I'm getting married in a few weeks) and had false lashes put on for the first time ever. My eyes teared up nonstop but I eventually got used to it.

Makeup,Top 5 Favorite - Lip Glosses,"[Pictures are available on my profile, if interested!]

✴ TOP 5 Favorites - Lip Gloss

......

➡️ NOTE: This is MY opinion &amp; experience; regarding product quality. As always, use the products that make YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun.

......

I'm sure it comes as no surprise, but I'm a makeup collector. I collect makeup products of all sorts! 


For this series, I really want to hone in on the products in my collection (by category) that have truly stood out to me, &amp; ones that I keep returning to over-and-over again. 


For this first installment, I thought it would be fun to start with lip gloss. Lip gloss is something that I use every single day - regardless if I'm wearing makeup or not. 


For me, there are certain attributes of a lip gloss which can define it as 'good' or 'bad' -  


I have heavily lined lips, so I need a gloss to automatically 'juice' up my lips &amp; camouflage those lines! The scent is another factor; I prefer a sweetly scented gloss. Lastly, I look for glosses that provide a sheer wash of color with a slight glimmer to them in order to reflect light. 


Please read on below to check-out my TOP 5 most-favorite (in order from least to greatest) lip glosses in my entire collection &amp; why: 

......

▪️Lip Gloss #5 - Bobbi Brown - 'Crushed Oil-Infused' Gloss

+ Color Description: sheer brown

+ Applicator: small paddle

+ Shade: 'Free Spirit'

+ Scent: oranges

+ Price: $29 (Ulta)

+ Comments: I just love how this gloss pairs with any lip liner. It is also so incredibly cushiony &amp; comfortable on the lips.

......

▪️Lip Gloss #4 - Milani Cosmetics - 'Keep it Full' Nourishing Lip Plumper

+ Color Description: sheer pink w/ gold shimmer

+ Applicator: large doefoot

+ Shade: '04 Luminoso'

+ Scent: peppermint

+ Price: $9 (Ulta)

+ Comments: this does not feel like a plumping gloss at all - it's very mild. I use this so much that I'm almost out of this tube &amp; really need to pick up another replacement!

......

▪️Lip Gloss #3 - Fenty Beauty - 'Gloss Bomb' Universal Lip Luminizer

+ Color Description: sheer pink w/ shimmer

+ Applicator: large doefoot 

+ Shade: 'Fu$$y'

+ Scent: fruit punch kool-aid packet

+ Price: $19 (Sephora)

+ Comments: I don't wear this a whole lot, because it's expensive &amp; I save it for best. When I'm going on a date, or going to a party, this is what I reach for. I love it ESPECIALLY because of its unique scent, it smells great!

......

▪️Lip Gloss #2 - Gigi Gorgeous Cosmetics - 'Less is More' Lip Gloss

+ Color Description: sheer pink w/ silver shimmer

+ Applicator: large doefoot

+ Shade: 'Get Into It'

+ Scent: cupcakes

+ Price: $4 (Amazon)

+ Comments: Oddly, this is one of my favorites! I bought it resale because I've always loved Gigi &amp; wanted to try her makeup. This certainly did not disappoint. 

......

▪️Lip Gloss #1 - ShopMisu - 'IXIA' Lip Gloss

+ Color Description: sheer red tint w/ multicolored glitter particles

+ Applicator: large doefoot 

+ Shade: 'IXIA'

+ Scent: cinnamon bubblegum

+ Price: ? (they are bringing it back soon)

+ Comments: my absolute favorite! I love how this catches the light &amp; makes my lips look so good! It pairs well with any liner, &amp; is perfect when your lips are dry.

Makeup,What kind of eyeliner won't make my eyes water and my nose run all day long?,"I have a question I want to ask about makeup, specifically eyeliner, but I have some things to explain first. Not that I think this will matter much, I'll say it anyway, I am a guy, not a girl.

I suffer from what is known as seasonal allergies, unfortunately the allergens that I react to include things that are in the air all year long, so I suffer all year long.

I'm allergic to dust mites, mold (both indoor and outdoor types), several grasses, several weeds, oak trees, pine trees, and cedar trees.

As you can see it's quite a bit, I was allergic to about 75% of the environmental allergens they tested me for. Since I'm allergic to so much, I now have to administer immunotherapy allergy injections to myself every week.

I'm not sure what it is in some eyeliners that cause my eyes to water and my nose to run like they do, but I really like to wear eye makeup because thanks to the allergies I also have massive dark circles under my eyes that I try to cover up, or I would like to try to use it to my advantage with some mild smoky eyes to add mystery.

But I only ever used one waterproof eyeliner that didn't make my eyes water and my nose run, it was by Almay but it's been discontinued.

I read online that any waterproof eyeliner is likely to cause an allergic reaction because of the oil base that makes it waterproof. 

But I was hoping surely someone out there has had experience, or used, or knows of some waterproof eyeliner that I can put on my waterline that won't cause my nose to run like a dripping faucet, or my eyes to water so profusely.

Help me, please?",2021-08-03 14:29:50

Makeup,Suggestions for medium/buildable coverage foundation that won't stick to beard...,"Hi!

I had rosacea really bad as a kid and in my early 20's started wearing foundation to help mask some of the redness.  The rosacea is much more under control and rarely flares up, but I still wear foundation to even out my face.  (I'm 38 now)

I used to use Revlon Colorstay liquid, but looked for something lighter/more natural and ended up with Physicians formula CC cream.  I really like it - it provides enough sheer coverage that if needed i could use some colorstay powder over.  


I always wear ""shortish stubble"" (usually a number 3 on my beard trimmer) on my face and neck.  Now that i'm getting older, the hair on my face is getting lighter and or white in spots.  So now, these liquid makeups are really sticking to it and you can really notice it - it doesn't look so great anymore.  My whole goal is just inconspicous.  

I read online that maybe mineral foundations would be good - and not stick to the beard as much.

Does anyone have this issue and found something that works or can reccommend some products?

Makeup,Word of caution for lash lifts,"I love lashlifts, my lashes always lift amazingly (check photo), been doing it for years. 

Yesterday I had my first failed lash lift. Zero curl, zero lift. I've attached photos of before and after. The beautician is one I absolutely love and have been going there for years now, I know she's good, she didn't do anything different.

The only two things that were different this time and the reason I'm posting this is to bring awareness and maybe help make more informed Decision:

1. My period is just about to start, hormones sometimes play a role, although I've had it close to a period before and they lifted more than that.

2. It's been 5 days since my second Covid vaccine. We think this is the reason why my body completely rejected the lift and there were no results. If you have a lash lift booked, make sure it's been at least 14 days since any vaccine to potentially avoid a result like mine and a 6 week wait to get it done again.

But yes, hope this helps. Bit of a bummer as I'm leaving on a holiday in 2 days and was looking forward to not having to wear mascara for the whole trip, but I should have thought it through beforehand and had the lift a week or two ago.

Makeup,Acne-friendly Make-up and how to use it?,"Hi!

I am a bit of a beginner, when it comes to make-up. I don't really know how to do much, I can put on mascara and that is kinda it. However, currently I use nothing at all.   
I get my brows and lashes coloured once a month, that's it.

&amp;#x200B;

But I want to get a bit more into make-up. The reason I stopped using mascara was because my current one would make my acne go crazy. It made me kinda sad to stop, because I loved the extra length that it gave me. I have considered maybe just getting fake lashes if there isn't a ""friendly brand""

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I would like to learn how to put on things like eyeliner, lipstick and eyeshadow.  I literally know nothing, not what colour that fits me, not what brand is good so and so on. I only know I like really deep red lipsticks, but I always feel weird wearing it.

It is not that I wouldn't also like to learn how to apply blushes or powders or whatever it is called. I am just so scared of freaking out my skin.

For things like price range, Idk. If there is some good cheap-ish options, I would like that.

&amp;#x200B;

If a picture of me would help, I can do that. I'm just a little worried about showing my face. But I am blonde with ice-blue eyes, my skin is pretty pale. I am very square-faced, I have been told my cheekbones are very defined.",2021-08-05 20:33:49

Makeup,Advice or tips for watering eyes,"I love to do fun eye makeup but over the course of a few years I can barely keep any makeup on my eyes because they just water so bad in the outer corner.

I switched over to just using eyeshadows and that worked for a bit but now my eyes will start to water after I finish the eye look and then it becomes difficult to apply mascara to finish it off. I have tried drugstore and top of the line eyeshadows and it happens with both and some shades (pinks, reds, purples) it is worse.

Makeup,Makeup skills seem to have atrophied?,"Does anybody else fee as though since March 2020 their ability to do their makeup has just…. Completely atrophied?

I’ve been playing with makeup and doing it for my own fun since I was a little girl, I’ve NEVER had trouble doing it before, it was always something that just came so natural to me. Half the time I’d do it on autopilot.
It’s always been a routine that’s brought me joy and a sense of satisfaction, but nowadays I literally can’t get a single thing right.

It’s gotten to the point that I get so frustrated and upset, I end up taking it all off.
Every day.

I feel like a little kid clutching crayons, not like the precision artist I used to be. I literally can’t do eyeliner anymore, and for context, I used to get compliments all the time on my ‘perfect’ wings.

I have some compounding severe anxiety issues which definitely make my situation particularly bad (some compulsive issues that don’t allow me to stop, I HAVE to try and do it again), but I’m just wondering if anybody else is similarly going through this?

Makeup never used to be something I had to think about about, and in the most positive way possible, it was a huge part of my personality, and I’m really struggling to understand/help myself find the joy and fun in it again.

Is there anybody who relates or feels similarly? How have you dealt with it/are dealing with it?

Makeup,"Too Faced ""Golden Beige"" is too orange/pink for me, despite claiming to have yellow undertones. What shade should I exchange it for?","I spent $70 on a Too Faced Born This Way foundation and a matching Born This Way concealer both in the shade ""Golden Beige"". I looked at online swatches and tested on my hand before buying, and it looked like it will go with my skin. But when I actually tested the products on my face, it looked super orange on me, and too pink in sunlight.

Does this mean I have neutral undertone or olive undertones? If so, what shade in that foundation/concealer line should I exchange it for? I have light-medium skin, and I don't know what undertones I have. I only know that I don't have pink undertones.",2021-08-06 03:44:17

 What are the basics that I need to get? Any brand suggestions that are not too expensive but are also well made? I would like vegan and cruelty free. I have been told I should get a concealer and foundation, but I'm not sure how to choose these. Should I just go to an Ulta or Sephora and ask? Any suggestions for tutorials on YouTube.

I really like the look of contouring and have been watching YouTube videos online to get more of an idea of how to do it.

Then I follow it up with Lancôme blur and go primer. After I use makeup forever ultra hd foundation… a little blush and urban decay all nighter setting spray.

👉 Black Radiance - 'True Complexion HD' Primer 


First-Impression Review: the first thing I noticed about this is that it is HEAVILY scented like SPF. This primer is tinted - &amp; it actually gives you light coverage, so it acts almost as a BB cream. After wearing it for a few minutes, it heavily oxidized on my skin. It has a nice glowing finish. I really liked how it lightly filled in my pores &amp; smoothed out my cheek texture.

👉 Wet n Wild - 'MegaLast Incognito' All-Day Full-Coverage Concealer 


First-Impression Review: this concealer has a super nice creamy consistency. It did provide me with full-coverage. After applying, it looked rather smooth on my undereye, moreso than other concealers! After wearing it for a little while, I didn't find it to aggressively crease like other concealers I've tried. Be forewarned - this concealer sports a VERY heavy perfume-like fragrance.

👉 Lottie London - 'Ready Set! Go' Setting Powder 


First-Impression Review: I was getting aggravated with this packaging, as there are not enough holes to easily dispense the powder. It takes forever to muster up a small, useable pile. This powder has no fragrance to it. Upon using it, it greatly lightened up my complexion with its white cast. I was definitely not a fan of the way it emphasized texture both under my eyes &amp; on my cheeks. 


➡️ Shade: True Transluscent

💰 Price: $3.22 (sample) • F/S = $9.68 (Lottie London) [current conversion rate]

👉 Realher - 'Definer' Brow Pencil 


First-Impression Review: this is one of the nicer brow pencils I've come across. It has a really tiny precision tip, making it extremely easy to get the marks exactly where you want them. I found this to be just the right consistency for staying-power: creamy enough to use, but not overly-creamy where it's going to slip-and-slide all over your face. The color was a great match, &amp; I did enjoy the pigmentation. The attached spoolie is very useful, &amp; worked well. 


➡️ Shade: Eye Am Grateful

💰 Price: $16.00 (Realher)

👉 Revlon - 'So Fierce!' Prismatic Palette 


First-Impression Review: upon first touching these shadows, they felt very smooth &amp; creamy in their pans. This is a 'baked gelee' formula, &amp; it was my first time ever trying this type of formula out. I did end up getting slight fall-out. I think that the arrangement of these shades makes a really cute go-to eye look for every day, or this palette is perfect for slight washes of color. I really enjoyed using this. 


➡️ Style: 963 Slight Flex

💰 Price: $10.99 (Ulta)

🚦 Rating: A

......

👉 KAB Cosmetics - Lip Kit 


First-Impression Review: this lip kit comes with both a sharpenable lip pencil as well as an opaquely-colored gloss. Both of the colors match each other. The gloss has a large doefoot applicator &amp; a soft vanilla fragrance. I didn't find it to be sticky at all. When I wore this kit, I got a very 'vinyl'-looking finish. It felt awfully heavy on my lips, &amp; I couldn't wait to wipe it off. I think this product is great for short-term wear, like for photography. It also got all over my teeth.

Makeup,How to apply eyeshadow if you can't wink?,"I can't wink - no matter how hard I've tried I cannot wilfully close one eye while leaving the other open.

Makeup,My Skin Turns Red With Basically Every Movement,"Just to preface this - I am a dude.

For my entire life, my face has always been very sensitive. And because of this it gets red extremely easy. If I smile for more than two seconds, my face goes blood red and it will literally will stay red for like another minute after that. If I laugh its even worse. If I yawn or try to make my face even just slightly expressive, my face goes red. I've always hated this redness. Whenever I laugh when others are around , people immediately point out my redness and state I'm blushing because I'm embarrassed or something to that extent (which I'm not). And I know that they're not being rude or anything because I've looked in the mirror when laughing - my face goes so red its impossible to not notice and point it out. And it doesn't even need to be a big hearty laugh - even just a small chuckle will usually turn my face into a tomato (as a smile will).

I feel like I'm repeating myself a lot, but basically, my face turns red at basically every single movement expect talking. Because of this, I've always tried to stop smiling and laughing when I'm in public, and I've also always tried to keep my face movements to a minimum. The thing is - I hate doing this, and obviously, this doesn't always work and there are still a lot of times when my face turns bright red when I'm with other people because of my sensitive skin (not to mention this means I have to act pretty emotionless and monotone which isn't exactly a fun personality to hang around). I've tried makeup in the past, but the one's I've tried have always been too thin to cover the redness, or too thick that it's clearly visible I'm wearing loads of makeup (and not in an attractive way). Are there any products that could cover my red face and still be more discrete (i.e. so that someone I'm talking to wouldn't notice I'm wearing makeup). I'm specifically looking for products that can cover more than just mild redness like acne, but real like traffic light redness lol.

Makeup,[Recommendations] Dupe for Bourjois Smoky Stories 02 Over Rose,"Hey everyone.

It seems it's been discontinued though so I'm looking for a dupe that would preferably not break the bank but also be blendable and long lasting. 

I've seen the shades compared to Urban Decay's Naked 3 palette and looking it pictures, that seems to be correct. SO searching for dupes of that I came across the Makeup Revolution Iconic 3. However, this one is very cheap and I don't know what to expect in terms of quality from it.

Wouldn’t you get it on stuff like your car seats and what not as you go about your day? Also if you’re wearing a crop top or even just a tank top and shorts and you want the body makeup on…. How do you do your back? It just doesn’t seem like a practical or realistic thing to wear unless you’re just doing a photoshoot and someone else puts it on you.

If there's anything else I should add or remove, plz let me know

I would assume that people wash their faces before applying makeup, but I wanted to make sure that using products like an exfoliant wouldn't hurt me if I happened to use it with a makeup product.

should I avoid mixing certain chemicals that appear in certain makeup brands that don't mix well?

However, I feel pretty intimidated by these makeup products because I've seen how cakey they can get if not applied correctly.

So my questions are, how long did it take you to learn how to use these products? How long did it take to find the right brand and shade for you? Do associates at makeup stores like Ulta help you find your shade? 

Thank you!",2021-07-04 06:29:41

21 - 23: red lipstick all day everyday.

I have both ulta and sephora fairly close to me, as well as Macy's, Nordstrom and I belive even Saks.

I also did a bit of searching and the only recommendation I could find was for a Neutrogena product that was somewhat similar. I also have rose hip oil and squalene from the ordinary but they don't give that same glow that future dew does. 

I have super dry, non breakout prone skin,  so something that is on the oiler or shiny side is totally fine.  

Budget is pretty much whatever. I'd prefer to not be in the $100+ a bottle range, but if it's great then I'll probably buy it even if it's expensive. I'm also totally fine with drugstore brands.

👉 Physician's Formula - 'Butter Believe It!' Putty Primer 


First-Impression Review: the first thing I noticed with this is the STRONG tropical fragrance. In the pot, it has a very soft humectant-like texture. I like for solid primers to be more 'pore-filling', but this did only slight work on my pores. With all the butters in the ingredients, &amp; after trying it - I'd say this is more of a hydrating primer. To apply it to the full-face like the instructions say, it really needed to be built-up, which caused a very greasy &amp; heavy feeling on my skin. I would say this would work wonders for those with very dry skin!  I'm naturally biased against it, as I have normal skin &amp; it's just not suited for my skin type.

👉 Maybelline - 'BB Dream Fresh' Skin Hydrating Beauty Balm 


First-Impression Review: this claims to be a 'sheer tint', &amp; indeed it is. It's very sheer. It's also NOT buildable in the slightest. I did appreciate that it made my skintone look more even, giving me just enough confidence with my skin. After application, it felt nice &amp; light on my face, &amp; not like I was wearing makeup. This is definitely the type of product I'd keep returning to for 'every day' use, as it's not mask-like, but flattering. There is no fragrance to this product.

👉 L'Oreal - 'Infallible Pro-Glow' Concealer 


First-Impression Review: this has got to be the EASIEST concealer to blend out that I've ever used. I mean, it took ABSOLUTELY no work for a completely blended, seamless look. I ended up getting about a medium-coverage out of it, which is great for pairing with current popular skin tints &amp; light-coverage foundations (as the concealer doesn't sit too heavy atop the base). It gave my undereye an extremely hydrated &amp; healthy look, &amp; I just really enjoyed everything about it. However - the fragrance is difficult to get past! It has a VERY strong chemical-like scent straight out of the tube.

👉 Makeup Geek - Compact Highlighter 


First-Impression Review: the common denominator in all the Makeup Geek powdered products I've tried recently is that they are all SO messy. I'm talkin' EXTREMELY 'ruin your outfit or carpet' messy. As soon as I lightly dusted my brush in the pan, the kickup was substantial!  It got everywhere! On the positive side, this is an incredibly beautiful highlight. It shines bright in normal indoor lighting, &amp; when tested - the reflect is extraordinarily bright. I had no issue applying or blending out this formula.

👉 Maven Beauty - 'Rose Water' Setting Spray 


First-Impression Review: I know I always say this, but it's truly difficult to do a 'First Impression' on a setting spray, as the product doesn't have many physical qualities. Here's what I do know about my first experience: the spritzer mechanism is really nice. Some might consider it aggressive, though. I prefer a more aggressive, yet expansive spray width. The fragrance is just 'decent'. It's not my favorite, but it also doesn't smell too much like 'rose' (as the title may suggest). My favorite part about this setting spray, is that within a few seconds after application, I could actually feeling it settling into my skin &amp; setting my makeup. Very few setting sprays actually achieve this, so I'm really happy with this one! 


💰 Price: $22.00 (Fashion Nova)

👉 L.A. Girl - 'Keep It Playful' Eye Palette 


First-Impression Review: the L.A. Girl formula is really hit-or-miss in my experience, but when it's good, I mean - it is MARVELOUS. This palette did not disappoint. The mattes that I used blended with simplicity, &amp; the metallics are show-stopping. They even pick up well on a brush! The only downside to this palette, is that there is only one depth-option, so your looks are going to pretty much always going to lead in the same direction.  Although I may feel slightly limited with this color-story, I feel it's a great little palette to have on hand when I'm looking for a specific eye-look that can be created fairly swiftly. Also, it's DEFINITELY one that I can depend on to perform successfully.

I bought a random sunscreen online thinking it would be an oridinary white cast one but it turned out being tinted!!

As a guy, can I use this sunscreen. I'm scared people might think I'm wearing make-up. I've taken pictures of my skin before and after, and can't really notice a difference but still a bit hesitant about using it.

Makeup,Product to help my skin look smooth?,"I have always had bumpy and textured skin which I've come to terms with (tried everything; accutane, every skin product, etc.) Has anyone ever tried a (non-comedogenic!) product that helps to fill in texture/pores a bit?

I usually just do moisturizer + my cream concealer + my powder foundation, so something to go under the powder foundation to smooth out my skin would be amazing!

Makeup,What makeup product would you hoard in the event of a zombie apocalypse?,"I've tried **a lot** of makeup brands but haven't really fallen in love with any. I'm a sucker for cute packaging and impulse buy limited edition collections waayyy more than I should. The result? I've got tons of palettes that I feel so-so about with most of them sitting untouched in my drawer. 

I never buy the same product more than once because I just always feel meh about them. So, I'd love to know what your hands down gotta have makeup products are. I wanna know products that are so damn good that if they were to be discontinued you would stock up and protect your hoard at all costs. 

I have light skin, freckling, neutral undertones, green eyes, and copper hair. 

I'm 36 F and my skin tends to be dry dry dry (and even drier!). 

I'd love any recs for: 

* Primer
* BB or CC cream 
* Blush 
* Eyeshadow palette that would be great for daily looks but can also step in for a bit of glam every so often
* Eyeliner 
* Mascara 
* Brow pencil/gel/groomer 

Essentially I want to create a daily polished look that is fresh but can also amp it up every so often for a night out. My ultimate goal is to clear the clutter, find makeup staples I love, and keep my collection to a minimum of well-loved favorites. Thanks for the recs!",2021-07-07 03:14:26

Makeup,How to contour six-pack abs (aka styrene),"This is a widely requested body painting technique used to add more definition to the muscles, most popularly six-pack abs (aka styrene). There are a few things to keep in mind with  highlighting and contouring the abs:

&amp;#x200B;

* It’s a good idea to have skin tone foundations to start off
* Take note of natural shadows on your model’s body
* Go with the paints that match the natural skin tone and make it a little bit darker
* Shake up the paint bottle well and before pouring it into the airbrush, test a little bit directly on the skin of your model. See if you need to add any colors to match the natural skin tone for a more realistic look. Color theory will come in really handy here!
* Once you’re happy with the color, pour it into the airbrush spray
* Adjust PSI to the desired level and run a few tests on paper towel
* The areas of the body that move and create creases (such as knees, elbows) need to be elongated and scratched before you start painting on them. So if you’re contouring the model’s abs, ask them to stand up
* Follow the natural shadows and work section by section
* Research some photos of skeletal and muscular systems of the human body. They will serve as a great reference and help you train your eye to mimic the anatomy
* Adjust your viewpoint while you’re painting to get a better perspective
* Once you’re done with contouring, mix in some lighter colors for highlights
* Go on the perimeter of the shadow pairing the shadow with the highlight for a realistic look
* To remove any extra paint, take a sponge, rip apart the edge, put a little bit of water on it, and pull some of the surface color off. To tone down the colors, you can also blend in a little bit of setting powder using a sponge

Depending on the settings (outdoor vs studio), you can control how much heavier or lighter you’ll need to contour. Studio lighting tends to drown out the colors so it’s better to go heavier on colors. And on the contrary, it’s better to go softer if the model is planning on being in the daylight.",2021-07-08 01:58:43

Makeup,What are your thoughts on purchasing specific products for specific purposes?,"I was creating a peachy-orange monochrome look this morning and it got me thinking both in terms of this look and in general- how important is it to purchase specific items for each area of the face vs. using something you already have to get the job done? For instance, I needed an orangey blush which I don't own, so I just used some eyeshadow, and I've heard tell of MUAs limiting their collections by using products across the board instead of for one specific purpose (i.e. shadows for filling in brows and highlight/blush/contour, lipsticks as cream blushes, etc.).

So, is it all just marketing or does a gal (or guy) really need 19 different items to do a full face? I'm guilty of falling for the marketing for sure throughout the years, but I'm just curious what others think. Thoughts?",2021-07-08 04:31:13

Makeup,"I just started using makeup recently because I feel self-conscious, and now I feel self-conscious about wearing makeup.","I’m a teen who detested makeup for a while. I started getting into it more because I realized it’d make me feel better about my skin and eyeshape. I’ve been trying to find makeup I can get at drug stores that won’t make my already uneven/rough skin look worse. Essentially, I’ve hopped three foundations and concealers, and added a few extra things because I read some articles that all said the specific brand of makeup helps with uneven textured skin.   

The reason I’m writing this is because I was just in a store buying my third set of foundation and concealer and the other stuff, and my mom told me I shouldn’t because it’s too expensive and it probably wouldn’t work. She tried to convince me to try her powder foundation (and only the powder foundation) and not buy anything. I started feeling self-conscious about buying the makeup, even though I really wanted to try it before my trip to Wisconsin. I bought it anyway, but now because of her being against it I have a knot in my stomach about it. I just want to feel pretty like all the people who have such smooth skin/makeup, but now I just feel uneasy about everything.

Makeup,KENZZI IS A SCAM DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM!!!!,"There are way better IPL hair removal devices, that can be purchased for under $100 from Amazon that work 10x better! Kenzzi drop ships from China, they claim they don’t. But when I received tracking it was from China and after a month I still haven’t received the item. Also beware if you want to return it they will charge you a $75 restocking fee and won’t provide a shipping return label. And you’d have to ship it back to New Zealand which is about $50-$80 to ship back. They make it this way so they can force you to keep the item. Because why return it and loose $160 in the process when the item is only $180 with the $50 discount code. They probably pay around $20 for the hair removal you can literally find them on these Chinese website like AliExpress and alibaba for $20-$30 and looks exactly the same and is the same. There’s another Reddit post where they linked about 5 different websites and all of them had the same exact product as kenzzi each just had their own logo. If kenzzi does not drop ship from China why would tracking be from China? They also take down negative reviews on their website, many people have said they got their negative review taken down. I also wrote a negative review and the next day it was gone. They’re even so shady they make fake Reddit account to deceive and trick people. If you go on posts talking bad about kenzzi. All the Reddit users defending it are new accounts and only have 1-2 comments and 0 posts. And the comments are only defending kenzzi. I will link another Reddit post I made where I uploaded a video proving my claims. Don’t be tricked into believing all these YouTube influencers like I did. Kenzzi pays them a lot to say only positive stuff about them. I know this because my friend is a influencer and she told me so. Not going to say her name for her own protection. I’d also like to note that after 2 weeks tracking still showed nothing so I asked them to cancel it however they shipped it out anyways and said they couldn’t cancel. It’s like they tried to force me to keep the item. They said don’t worry you can always return it but never mentioned the $75 restocking fee and making me pay for my own label. Never even received the item I paid for that’s the worst part, luckily my bank gave me my money back. But kenzzi customer service did not help at all. Definitely one of the shadiest companies I’ve ever dealt with. There’s a website carrying the same exact product for $50 if they can make profit from selling it for $50 imagine how cheap they get it for. I will link the video showing the fake Reddit account kenzzi makes as well as another Reddit post where he links websites selling the same exact product and also claims kenzzi just drop ships a cheap Chinese product and puts it in a fancy box with a fancy logo.",2021-05-31 06:38:44

Makeup,Makeup makes me look old and dull. Why?,"I'm 31 and I think I have pretty good skin. It's even with no scarring and no acne. It's neither oily nor dry. However, I do have dark under-eye circles. I'm pretty sure they're genetic, because I had them even as a child and no matter what I use or do, they don't go away. Now, the problem is that under eye makeup and foundation make me look like crap. I gave up on foundation ages ago since I don't feel that I really need it anyway. For under-eye concealer, I've tried different techniques -- brush, beauty blender sponge, fingers, expensive concealers, moisturizing concealers, concealers with retinol, concealers with a pink tint and a yellow tint, cheaper concealers from drug stores, etc. NOTHING works. I've tried putting it all over my under-eye, just in the corner, just on the lower part where the shadow is, thick, thin. It all looks horrible. It ends up looking dry (even though I don't have dry skin), getting in my fine lines, making my circles more noticeable (??). Lately, I've just been going sans-makeup except for my brows and a bit of blush. My face looks younger without makeup, but my under-eye circles are horrible nonetheless.   


The other night I went out to see a show for the first time ever. I was excited and looked up tutorials on how to get good under-eye coverage. I went out and purchased a $30 concealer that the lady said was super moisturizing and wouldn't crease. I put it on and of course it's the same thing. I swear it aged me by at least 5 years.   


Is there ANY way to hide my dark circles without looking 5+ years older? Am I doomed to have glowing skin when I don't wear makeup but have to suffer the dark circles?",2021-06-02 06:13:32

I thought that it was just the powder but my concealer, before setting does that too. 
I’ve tried a few drugstore concealers, loose powder, pressed powder. And even applying it differently, such as not baking, not applying it with a sponge, etc etc but I’m still left with a flaky textured mess.
For more back story I’ve been moisturizing like right before I do my makeup and it moderately makes this issue a little better but not at all by much.

Makeup,Lost confidence and feeling like applying makeup is like putting lipstick on a dog,"I used to wear makeup in high school and it wasn't bad. I have hooded eyes (I'm white), but could get away with winged eyeliner. I have always had really good skin too, and for that, I'm very fortunate. In college, I felt I perfected it even a bit further, and I felt confident when going to parties, etc. 

Since covid started, I have barely left the house (I have a lung condition so I'm high risk). As a result, I have barely done my makeup. Usually, I feel average to below average in terms of my physical features. I'm 23 now, and when I do my makeup (for important work zoom calls, etc) I feel so ugly. I used to get a confidence boost, but now I almost feel worse after applying makeup. As I've gotten slightly older, I can't do my winged eyeliner anymore (and have resorted to a smokey pencil eyeliner look). My eyes are too small, too close, and uneven heights, my face is long (especially my forehead), my lips are too small, my jaw is too rounded front-on when I smile, and I have a very prominent ""roman nose""... I could go on. In the past, I felt effective at using makeup to ""fix"" my flaws, but now I feel like you just can't ""fix"" ugly. Part of me feels I totally need to revamp my makeup style/skills, but another part of me feels like ""what's the point"". Doing my makeup in the middle of the day to ""remind myself I can look pretty"" doesn't work anymore and I try not to take photos of my face anymore.

Makeup,i want to start client makeup but i have no base location ? what can i do ?,"I want to start client makeup but I have no location?

Hi guys , i’m 18 and I am somewhat of a beauty influencer . I’ve worked with brands on instagram and tiktok for campaigns such as Revlon, Lottie London, Makeup Revolution, etc. But in real life I want to venture out into client makeup because I know it would make a lot of money on the side and people love my work. 

However, I have two big issues: 
1- I live with my grandma and she doesn’t really like the fact that people can have her address since I go off to college in August and she’s scared that someone could potentially save her address and use it for a bad deed (especially if they see she’s the only other person there) 

2- I don’t have a car so I’d have to Uber/Lyft to work as a traveling makeup artist . 

My thing is, I could really only do traveling makeup artistry if I did group makeup in order to pay for the fee of the Uber/Lyft. I want to just charge a traveling fee but I know people around my age don’t want to pay a possible extra $20 on top of the $25 service. I also don’t want to undercharge my work ... I know i should be charging at least $30-35 but i would feel terribly bad and like I am overcharging if i make them pay that and the travel fee.

My favorite is serum foundations. I’m not a huge believer that you can add skincare to makeup. I think the two are separate. But, I like how natural serum foundations look and feel. And how you can have such a light coverage, but can also build it up. Also, I don’t feel like my skin is dying with it. 

 I also really like pressed powders. They’re like the fastest and easiest foundation to apply. I think it’s the best for beginners. Again, you can have a light and build it up.

What are your recommendations? Is NYX's Marshmellow Primer worth the hype? Or any of their Bare With Me primers (Hydrating Jelly Primer and the SPF one)?

Thank you very much for your help!",2021-06-05 04:49:09

Makeup,Recommendations/Guides for a Total Beginner,"I'm a trans girl and I'm just starting to come out, but I know next to nothing about what I'm doing. Makeup is one of my biggest obstacles to tackle. Can anybody help guide me through the process, assuming I know literally nothing and moving on from there?

Here's what I know, or think I know, or just helpful info about me:
I know I have hooded eyes. I know foundation is supposed to match in natural light, I think anyways. My eyebrows started out blonde and darkened some but they're still relatively light, so I'll probably need to focus on them a lot. My cheeks are naturally flushed, idk if there's anything I can do to change that or if it affects anything regarding makeup. Lastly, I have fair skin with pink undertones

I want to go for simple, alt, maybe gothic looks. I've always loved the way those styles look. Here's a pic I found that's pretty close to what I wanna go for I think

Most of my makeup went bad last year so I want to start rebuilding my collection later this year or next. I'm open to a mix of budget and high-end this time.

Makeup,New Skincare beauty cream free 1month supply," [https://samples4free.design](https://samples4free.design/)

So I came accross this new skincare beauty cream which they are offering free 1 month supply of thier product as a trial and to test it before buying consistently, I mean for me the free trial bottle offer is very great but the down part for me is if you don't read it carefully you will be subscribed after a week or two to their beauty program automatically so if you dnt like the product you dont have to wait till first month ends you need to cancel after a week or before to not join the program, the product is very good and it has potential so having the free bottle for only paying for shipping is a good deal even though for some of us 10$ is alot just for shipping but on the other hand seeing the product and its use is worth it in my opinion. So bottom end is anyone who want the bottle for free can get it and if you dont like it or see potential cancel your program before you pay for it automatically you just need to read and becareful, thats all you need to be SMART! So I hope this review enlighten you for the product and hope you like the product like I did. I love it to be honest. Enjoy beautiful people.😊😊",2021-06-06 04:24:17

Makeup,Something to fill-in pitted scars/ improve texture?,"Hey, 26M here. I had isotretinoin 7 years ago which cleared my face; I no longer have acne other than isolated pimples due to shaving irritation, face mask and so on, but no hormonal or sebum-related acne anymore. The thing is I was left with moderate acne scarring. It's not severe but under harsh lighting my scars are sooooo noticeable that I'd like to conceal them a bit. I tried dermaneedling and peels with little results other than texture improvement for a couple of months.

I know there are stronger treatments like subcision, ablative lasers, tca cross etc...but I'm too busy working, such treatments need long downtime/recovery with red/flaky skin.

Acne scars are difficult to treat even with expensive treatments, and I can't put up with all the hassle: traveling to go visit a good doctor, downtime, etc... After all, my skin is not that bad so it might be easier to conceal them when I'm working or dating someone, then use a cleanser at night to remove everything and let my skin rest whenI'm at home.

I don't wanna look made up, I was looking for something that can improve texture/lines etc...like silicon primers, matte moisturizers and things like these which contain silicons or ingredients which fill in pits. I know acne scars are deeper than pores and more difficult to cover, but there must be something which helps improving skin texture for people with scarring, even if it helps 25-30% improvement.

What should I do girls? I was thinking of a primer like benefits professionals?? Maybe something like effacer mat?

2) foundation ( for these two - I have acne prone combination skin that can get both greasy and dry at the same time and don’t like the suffocating/warm feeling that some foundation gives you - aka if there’s a good one where I can still feel like my face can breathe that would be great)
3) mascara (I have really long eyelashes that have a tendency to clump together with too much mascara, would also appreciate advice for this)

Makeup,My theories on why high end makeup brands are losing so much of their hype.,"So we all realized by now that drugstore makeup is way more popular than high end and I came up with some reasons as to why it’s like that

1. No one “promotes” them anymore. People used to watch those famous creators like Tati Westbrooke and Jeffrey Star to get accurate reviews. Ever since they fell off (bec of their scandals) no one has been watching them so they kind of forgot about them and the brands they promote. (I’m sure there are people that still review them I just don’t watch them).

2. Sponsorships. They don’t really do sponsorships or collabs with a lot of famous creators so their new makeup is sometimes unheard of. Ex; morphe is doing really well w their collabs w Charli and Dixie Damelio, Avani, Madison Beer, James Charles (in the past), etc.

3. People finally decided to put quality over quantity. Not to say that high end brands aren’t good at all, there’s a lot of products that are amazing, but people are starting to realize they can get the same thing or of the same quality for much much cheaper, which is a big factor as to why drug store makeup is becoming way more popular imo.

4. Their makeup is outdated. By outdated I mean it doesn’t fit the ‘aesthetic’ of what people like nowadays. Fenty beauty, rare beauty, and some others I can’t think of rn are doing really well rn but a lot of them are still stuck in the 2016 heavy makeup phase which is not the trend anymore.",2021-06-07 03:23:52

At the end of 2017 or beginning of 2018 my sister gave me a tube of Peach Perfect saying the color was too dark for her but it fit me really well and I loved the finish. However, I can’t for the life of me remember the shade name. She’s paler than me and I usually go for the second lightest foundation shade. I think I’m a cool yellow. I’m thinking marshmallow was the shade but it could have been swan which was the lightest shade at one point, right?

Any help would be appreciated!",2021-06-07 08:03:27
Makeup,foundation help,"hi! 

I am a 17 year old who is starting to get into makeup. 

I have been doing my eyeshadow for the past year, but recently, I decided to get into the foundation. 

What else do I need to go with foundation? Do I need contour? Concealer? If so, which brands do you recommend for dry skin? (Cruelty-free please)

I have a few scars on my cheeks from acne that are quite hard to cover with the foundation I tested out. 

I also currently only wash my face with water and moisturize with The Ordinary moisturizer because my last face wash was drying out my skin, so if you could recommend a good face wash, I would appreciate it",2021-06-07 09:26:23

Makeup,Synthetic vs Human hair fake lashes,"Hey guys,

I really need help on finding out how to tell the difference between synthetic and human hair fake lashes. I only wanna wear synthetic lashes but so many brands don't even write what the lashes are made out of. Are there any ways I can tell without wasting my money by doing the burn test? 

Like if its shiny in the light does it mean its synthetic??

Already tried researching online but no luck either. 

The lashes I'd like to find out if they're synthetic or not are:

Makeup,I'm too embarrassed to wear makeup,"Ever since I was very young, I've always loved makeup, and couldn't wait to be old enough to wear it.  The problem is that I also am an EXTREMELY sensitive person.  So much so that if someone makes the slightest remark to me, I will never get over it.  This isn't on purpose.  Believe me, I wish I wasn't that way, but I am, and probably always will be.  I finally got the courage to start wearing makeup when I was 16, and was made fun of by my entire family every time.  Even my mother made fun of me.  A few years later, I had enough of being teased, and stopped wearing it.  I am now 33, and still too embarrassed to wear makeup.  I have only worn chapstick in all these years, but I am still teased me people for everything, and know that it will happen again with makeup.

I know that all of this is probably hard for you to understand, and you're probably rolling your eyes at me.  I get it, but it's just how it's always been with me, and it sucks.

It's embarassing. Right now I'm using urban decay and it hasn't helped. My face becomes oily while wearing it after a couple of hours. Before that I used Nars. It was worse since for some odd reason the foundation would turn orange. So, I was literally a walking Donald trump. 

Now, in all seriousness. It is getting annoying. I would go without makeup entirely but my acne is awful. I have red marks on my nose and scars. Im highly frustrated with it.

The Tarte Amazonian butter Lipstick. 
I looked on Sephora website for Canada, it's not there. Looks discontinued. I liked the ingredients, the way it felt and the colours a lot. I liked every colour they had. I usually don't like any other lipsticks so I've turned to here to ask, are any of tarte's other lipsticks the same? Is there another quality brand that makes a similar one? Definitely looking for shades like ethereal pink, angelic nude, coral blossom.

So do you guys have any tips on a good eyelash curler thats nice for hooded, kinda ”flat”  eyes that you also dont need to pinch hard to curl the lashes? (If you get what i mean. Some lash curlers you dont even need to put a lot of preassure on and it curls the lashes very good)",2021-05-02 13:34:24

Makeup,I started being interested about makeup recently. This is the most important lesson I've learnt!,"I have learned that I have big nose, hooded eyes, sparse eyebrows, thin lips, dark under eye circles and oily, acne prone, sensitive skin.

I've never had problems with male attention nor did I think I looked unattractive. It is now that I'm learning about all of my ""undesirable"" face features that need masking or correcting, when insecurity and mild frustration creeps in. I'm turning to makeup industry to look better, ironically it just makes me feel somehow worse about myself. I'm not gonna fall for this trap. I appreciate the tips and tricks on how to experiment with makeup but I've decided that I'm not going to try my best to hide my natural features every day.

Makeup,What is your favourite BB cream?,"Recently, I switched out wearing foundation for BB cream. I wanted something that would even out my complexion without the heaviness of foundation, and so far I've been impressed with the two different ones I have tried.

Right now, I've been using Garnier BB Cream Classic, but the lightest shade 'Light' is still a bit too dark for my skin. I also gave L'Oréal BB C'est Magic a try, this one is probably my favourite of the two because it smells amazing and doesn't feel oily, which is perfect for me as I have a combination of oily and dry skin. But it doesn't quite provide the coverage I'm going for.

Makeup,Concealer brands / tips for DRY eyes,"Brief intro - I’m 21, and whilst I’m not a pro MUA or anything my makeup has always been nice for my face, I feel like I know what suits me and it goes pretty nicely. 

In the past year I developed eczema patches on my eyes which is another battle in itself. It’s left my under eyes and eyelids really dry no matter how much I moisturise!!! (Have tried many, only a couple are suitable without irritating tf out of my eczema). 

I’ve tried numerous concealers, currently using tarte shape tape. Whilst the coverage is good my makeup just looks horrible no matter what I do. I prime, blend my concealer with a damp beauty blender (brushes make my concealer look flaky) and set with LM translucent powder (baking is even more drying). I can’t not set my under eyes because they crease in 10 seconds. Set with UD all nighter setting spray after. 

I feel like the eczema has aged the skin around my eyes, and I just don’t have that smooth base anymore when I conceal, so I stay away from eyeshadow. My makeup literally doesn’t last at all and I have no idea what to do. 

Any concealers that you’ve tried that are hydrating with GOOD coverage as I have quite dark circles around my eyes would be really appreciated. Also any tips for how to save my makeup because it’s quite disheartening looking so crusty. 

Thanks !",2021-05-04 11:42:47

Makeup,Tips on how to work with a difficult eyeshadow palette?,"I bought the Smoke Sessions palette from melt last year and I've barely touched because of how difficult I find the shadows to work with. It's super disappointing because I adore green shades and I was so excited to create some fun looks but I just don't enjoy using because of the formula. 

The mattes are incredibly hard to blend and somewhat patchy. They're pigmented but as soon as you try to blend them out they look muddy. The shimmers are okay but the fallout is really bad, I try to do my eyes before my face but it's like the powder still comes off onto my cheeks throughout the day, if that makes sense. I've used two different primers, nyx glitter primer and the elf one. There wasn't much difference between the two.

Makeup,Felt tip eyeliner recommendations for a newbie,"I only use eyeliner and mascara as my daily makeup. My primary eyeliner is the ELF eyeliner pen because out of all the various applicators, it's been the easiest for me to apply and I like the more subtle ""coffee"" shade. I think it's about time for an upgrade, but I don't know where to start.

I'm looking for something very similar, but also an eyeliner that will last the entire day and applies a little more easily. (not using multiple swipes in one spot). I believe it's a very basic felt tip pen, but I've also not ventured out at ALL from elf because of budget. 

I'm don't like the way a full face feels or anything that will sit heavy on my face . I'm also a little lazy. Pencils and liquid applicators haven't worked well for me I'm the past so please don't suggest them. (unless they're even better suited for lazy ol me)

Makeup,Urban Decay inked brow! How come I have discovered this product just now?,"Let me tell you my eyebrow situation: overplucked and completely missing ends. Years ago, I've had them microbladed and it didn't really help that much because it faded in few weeks to the point that I had to draw them with pencil or liquid pens anyway. Of course, that comes with all kinds of problems - I couldn't touch them because they'd smudge, even the waterproof ones are not that waterproof, the colour bleeds into surrounding skin, and they are not immune to my oily skin. 

I've decided I'll try Urban Decay brow ink that claims to last put for 3 days. I didn't expect it to last half a day if I'm honest but I was so wrong! When I tried the shade on my hand, it wouldn't come off even when rubbing it with make up remover wipes, or several hand washes. When I put it on my eyebrow, I've realised that the brush is easy to work with and there is possibility for even shading, depending how much of the liquid I put on the brush. It looks natural, matt and stayed on even after wiping with make up wipes, and 2 facewashes - 1 in the shower. I did try to avoid rubbing the brow area with face scurbing sponge but some really aggressive soap definitely went in. The very edges do come off a little after the shower but most of it is still on. The best features of this product are that it stays matte and I can touch my eyebrow anytime during the day. 

I am so impressed with it that I want to buy more products from this brand. What are your experiences? Also, did anyone try the microblading pen?",2021-05-08 07:33:46

Makeup,Breaking my heart and my highlighter over and over again.,"So, I love my Becca highlighter. I use it all the time for EVERYTHING from cheeks to eyes. I’ve been having a problem with it breaking though. I keep using alcohol to put it back together, only for it to shatter days after. 

I reconstitute in its original pan, should I be putting it into eyeshadow pans or something like that? 

Should I actively press it while it’s drying out? 

Are there any tips you can give me to help me preserve my sanity and my highlighter? 

It doesn’t help that I’ve heard they are going out of business this fall.",2021-05-09 01:23:23

Makeup,Recommendations for phasing out foundation (or at least not looking like I'm wearing it)?,"Hey folks. Due to past experiences with bad acne/hyperpigmentation, I have a bad habit of hiding behind foundation but I'm kind of over it-- I don't like the look or the feeling of foundation. I would love to go with a much lighter option (esp. since my skin is clearing a bit and I have a better skincare routine now) but I still have pretty bad skin, so I think some coverage is inevitable.

What lighter feeling/looking routines do you recommend for very oily skin with large pores and hyperpigmentation/redness? Longevity is an issue for me-- even a mattifying primer/foundation combo (both silicone based) doesn't hold up.

Less expensive recommendations are always better, considering I'm expecting to waste a lot of it trying different things until I find something that clicks. Also, I'm not necessarily 100% anti foundation-- just wanting to go a lot lighter, so if you happen to have an amazing light foundation recommendation, I'm open.

tldr: would very much love some ""no makeup"" or light makeup routine/recommendations for shitty skin.",2021-05-09 07:31:07

Makeup,Looking for best shade match for M.A.C. Mineralize Concealer (NW20)!,"Hey all!

So I really want to try out the E.L.F. hydrating camo concealer, but because of COVID, the drug stores don't allow you to test the product (obviously). Right now I have the MAC mineralize concealer in NW20 which is like 2 years old and I'm still using it, but want to branch out into something cheaper.

What shade would be best in the E.L.F. concealer? I think I am cool toned since the MAC store matched me to NW20, but am confused how to translate that over to E.L.F.

Any help would be great! I don't wear a lot of makeup. Most of the time it's just a bit of highlighter and mascara. I want to start doing a fuller make up routine, but like in 5 minutes instead of 2 minutes haha.",2021-04-02 09:15:09

Makeup,Help me find a foundation I actually like!!," 

I have never really loved any foundation I have used and now I'm desperate honestly. The first foundation type product I used was Clinique tinted moisturiser (the old one) and I loved it however this was when I was about 13 and didn't have a single bit of oil or any blemishes so it didn't really have to do anything.

I developed acne as I got further into my teens and used Estee Lauder double wear for some more coverage, I loved it but after a while I got fed up as it just felt too heavy. I started using L'Oreal Infallible 24hr foundation and I just dealt with it, I didn't love it but it gave me coverage and lasted throughout the day it was also way too pink for my yellow undertone skin. I have also tried Clinique superbalance but it turned so orange and melted off my face, MAC Studio Fix but I didn't like the smell and it was too pale I could never find the right shade in, Armani Luminous Silk foundation made my face look like I'd submerged myself in a bottle of olive oil by the end of the day and all Maybelline foundations broke me out terribly.

And yes I have tried primers with the foundations that didn't stay on.

I need a foundation that does the following

1. Covers my acne (its not super bad anymore just a few blemishes and leftover scars)
2. Won't break me out
3. Will stay put
4. A nice finish, not too matte not too dewy just a skin like finish
5. Not too heavy
6. Won't turn orange or make me look like a ghost
7. Is available in the UK

Makeup,Trouble with winged eyeliner on hooded eyes,"Hey there and sorry if this is a stupid question,

I am relatively new to makeup and I am learning how to do winged eyeliner on my relatively hooded eyes. I watched a few video tutorials and they all say to do anything regarding the eyes looking forwards eyes open with relaxed brows, but I find it very difficult to get nice solid lines this way because if I don't arch my brows or close my eyes the skin above my eyes (the ""hood"" I guess) is just kind of very.. flappy skin? Sorry for the weird description lol but basically it is not taut at all and if I try to draw on it with a pencil or liner while it is in its natural state I always get terrible squiggly lines because I apply some pressure and it's very soft and foldy.

So currently I do my winged liner the regular method, which comes out well enough, but then a large portion of what does show of my lid is just black and I already have small eyes and I wear glasses (nearsighted) so I think it just highlights how small my eyes are. Despite that I do really like how winged liner looks on me otherwise and would like to make it look even better. Does anyone else have this issue and know what to do about it?",2021-04-04 20:06:20

Makeup,I really want to wear very natural makeup.,"I want to wear make up to make myself feel prettier, to look more professional, and just to make myself feel a little more girly. However, when I try to do make up I look weird and it’s just way too much. I never like the make up look unless it’s a very very natural make up. How exactly do I achieve this look? I’ve been wanting to get into tinted moisturizer instead of foundation. Just because I feel like foundation makes me look really thick and caked up. Any suggestions? Right now I just do a little mascara, maybe a little color on my eyebrows, and some lipgloss. But I want to do a little bit more whenever I’m going out to dinner or whatever. Please send me some suggestions!",2021-04-05 03:42:55

Makeup,Help! I'm considering doing my own bridesmaid makeup for my friend's wedding; need advice/tips/suggestions!,"So for the 5 times I've gotten my makeup done in my life so far, it's been very hit or miss as someone with hooded Asian eyes. My friend is letting us decide if we wanna get our makeup done for her wedding. Out of the 13 ppl in the bridal party, I'm the only one with this eye shape. I've scrolled though the hundreds on pics of the MUA and I only saw a pic of one person with my type of eye shape.To save money and just in case I dislike how they do my makeup, I'm thinking of just doing my own with what I have. I'm not an expert, but in the past year I've watched a lot of makeup videos hence I'm learning but also started getting more makeup as a result. 

Any tips/advice for bridesmaid makeup, regardless of what the outfit colors will be? Any unwritten rules I should know about such as the type/shade of lip product I should use(glossy, matte, etc.) or a certain eyeshadow color scheme?

Any tips to avoid flashback? I used Tarte Shape Tape and WnW Reserve Your Cabana and it was horrible flashback 😭 Is it a matter of the concealer being too light or applying too much powder with a wet BB or the application method or both? 

I own the following eyeshadow palettes:
- UD: Naked 1 Palette (new from 2018), Born to Run, Ultraviolet
- Viseart: Paris Edit, Midsommer and Solstice 
- Huda: Nude Light 
- Colourpop: Midnight Masquerade, Snow Much Fun

Makeup,Doing brows for people with very thin and blonde brows?,"Hey y’all!

In a nutshell, I have blonde hair, and naturally, my eyebrows are blonde as well- however, they’re not platinum blonde. They’re visible as an ash darker blonde. My eyebrows are also very thin, and I have no clue how to fill them in.

I always go for natural looks, so filling them in completely (like the way people who do full glam looks do) isn’t exactly my speed. Id love to have the look of soap brows, only that my eyebrows are so thin and light enough for it to look a little ridiculous when I try. 

Ive come to accept that ill have no choice but to fill them in, but I was wondering what products to use to achieve a more natural look?

By far the biggest issue I’ve had with many of my brow products is I can never find the right colour. Darker blonde looks to yellow for my ash toned hair, while light browns come off as way too red. 

Any tips, what style brow product would give natural looking brows for my so-thin-they’re-practically-non-existent brows? As much as products like brow gels are natural, they barely do anything for me as they can only fill and accentuate whats already there.

Also, any tips for brands that sell more ashy-toned colours?

Fortunately except for a few days of the year I don't get very bad watery eyes, and when that strikes I know makeup is just an impossible dream.

Makeup,"Complete beginner at makeup, have questions about nails.","When I say complete beginner I mean it, I know nothing at all. Literally nothing. Just wanna clarify that before people start using terms that I won’t understand.

Basically I just want to use nail polish to start, it seems the easiest. I just have no idea what I’ll need, and all googling/YouTubing gives me is tutorials on how to be a professional :/. 

So first, the brush thing comes with the nail polish right? I don’t have to buy it separately do I?

Does nail polish come off by itself or do I have to get the remover stuff? And how long should you keep the polish on before removing it?

Besides from the nail polish(and maybe the remover if I need it) is there anything else that’s and absolute MUST get? Like not something that’ll just make it easier or anything, something that you HAVE to get in order to do your nail polish?",2021-04-07 02:53:01

Makeup,I found a great Glossier Generation G Lipstick Dupe!,"Step 1:   Buy a Wet n Wild MegaLast Lip Color for like $2USD. It's a semi-matte lipstick bullet.

Step 2:   Lose it in an old purse or makeup drawer for 1-2 years.

Step 3:   Find it when cleaning things out. Check for signs of mold / bacterial growth / rancid smell.

Step 4:   If no clear signs of grossness besides the expiration date, dab it on your lips (don't drag) until you've achieved desired color payoff. 

No blotting needed, gives a soft, diffused look. Semi-sheer, matte texture...no mirror necessary. Looks shockingly similar to Glossier Generation G lipstick.

Makeup,Minimalistic Summer Makeup Routine with only 3 Products,"*The heat’s on.*

Just like a stove, the temperature is shooting up. When it comes to makeup in summers, it is better to ***‘identify the essential, eliminate the rest.’*** 

The last thing one would like to do is layering up tons of makeup. Going minimalistic with minimal products is the best possible solution to avoid situations like melting of makeup due to excessive heat. No one wishes to carry loads of makeup. Rather one wishes to go minimalistic with the products too. 

Here’s **a short guide** for all of you who are looking for a **soft and light summerish makeup look** for a hot and humid day with **only 3 makeup products.** 

***For the base:*** 

***Using a concealer without foundation*** will help you get rid of those layers of makeup. A foundation might melt away due to soaring temperatures. A concealer would help in covering the dark circles, dark spots, or any other blemishes. Thus, say yes to concealer and no to foundation. 

**Applying a bit of loose powder** under the eyes would help in settling the under-eye. It also helps in making the makeup last longer.

***For the eyes:***

Apply the **left over loose powder** on the eyes with a brush to create an eye base. To add a tint of color, one can **use a lip tint** in shades of pink or peach. This would give the eyes a fresh and new look. 

**For the cheeks:** 

A **small amount of lip tint** can be used on the cheeks to give blush to the cheeks. The blush on cheeks gives a great lift up to the entire face. 

Blend the tint with your middle finger in a circular motion on your cheeks to get that perfect glow. 

**For the lips:** 

Of Course the lip tint was meant for the lips!

**Applying the same lip tint** on your lips would be great. You can also top it up with a lip color or a gloss for that perfect sheen. 

**P.S: The above makeup routine must be done after CTM (Cleansing, Toning, Moisturizing) for better and long-lasting results.**",2021-04-07 19:27:06

Makeup,Which brands are vegan/cruelty-free and available in Germany?," high-endHi, there!

Currently, I’m looking for makeup that is cruelty-free and vegan. (I’m not happy about the fact we still need to test on animals instead of paying people to test it.) But for some reason, the big shops in Germany only sell the normal makeup brands (e.g., MAC). And those that are available and vegan are influencer brands that I don’t want to support (Jeffree Star, Kylie cosmetics).

I already thought about buying NARS. However, since they sell in China, they aren’t cruelty-free anymore.

Do you guys know brands that are vegan and cruelty-free and available in Germany?

P.S.: it would be cool if it’s high end. I want to have quality for the money I pay. Not just a name.",2021-04-07 21:08:16
Makeup,How do I make concealer not slow down the healing of a scab,"I'm a guy who does not use makeup, however recently I went very hard on a huge blind pimple on my forehead, and while it seems to be gone, I destroyed the skin in that area and now I have a huge scab. 

I think this scab is very noticeable and recently I wore concealer on it to hide it when I had a zoom date with a girl from uni. The concealer works fine from the webcam but I don't want to wear it outside as I do not want people to notice that I use makeup. I will see that girl again tonight for an online board games night with other friends, and on Saturday for a walk, so I was thinking of using the concealer again tonight.

However, I fear that using the concealer will slow down the healing of the scab. Especially when I remove it, I notice that the wound seems further from healing than when I put it on. Is there any way I can mitigate this?",2021-04-07 21:46:29

Makeup,Eye shadow creasing help,"I didn't used to have an issue with creasing too badly, but since I upped my skin care routine I guess it has made my lids a bit greasier and I am not sure what to do about it! 

I don't have luck with any of my current primers. The ones I've tried are Anastasia (hate), UD Potion Primer (used to work, less productive now), UD anti-aging pp (seems too greasy), and Smashbox (best of the bunch).

I have the best luck with the Smashbox, but it's not perfect and still creases many days after not many hours.

I would take suggestions for how to clean my lids better before application, how to apply my products without interfering with my makeup, or product recs.

come to put it on... and i look SO dry, crackly and dehydrated. it doesn’t want to blend in and sits so terribly on my oily/combo skin even with a whole skincare routine &amp; a moisturizing primer. it emphasized dryness that i didn’t even know i had!! none of my other foundations look like this on me and i’m so so disappointed. i tried applying it with a blender at first, then a brush, then another brush, and it all looks terrible.

in addition to that, the consistency of it is so unappealing to me; it feels so oily and slippery. since i did get it from an exchange, i’m not sure if a new bottle would give me different results. not calling the person i bought from shady but i mean you never know.

I've found a colour that seems to compliment my skin tone (doesn't make my face change colour but seems to ""smooth"" it out and thus far have been trying a brush but I've noticed that it seems to look a little patchy especially on my cheeks/nose as though perhaps there hasn't been quite enough product. 


My routine is as such:


- Double cleanse
- Serum
- Moisturise
- Prime (after about 5 mins to let moisturiser ""set"")
- Apply foundation (after a couple mins)


I have combination skin and apply a couple of pumps to the back of my hand before using the brush to apply. Mostly it feels more as though perhaps the product just isn't actually going very far (if that makes sense) and that the ""patchiness' is where there isn't enough product to actually provide a base.


I've watched quite a few videos and they all seem to be using around the same sort of amount I've used so I'm not sure if it's a case of my technique and needing practice, or considering that every skin is different and being brave enough to apply a bit more. I'm very new to make-up in general so there's a bit of ""oo that looks like a lot..."" going on.


Any general pointers would be much appreciated and yes, I know I'm overthinking! xD",2021-04-08 20:35:12
Makeup,Ben Nye SK-1 Tattoo Cover?," Hi everyone,   
I've watched multiple Youtube videos about covering tattoos with makeup but I still have a few questions that I was hoping some of you could answer! 

  
I have a tattoo on my forearm that's around 4 inches, a pretty simple abstract tattoo, so it's mostly made up of black and light blue lines (with one small area, around the size of half a pinky, that's shaded black). 

  
I was wondering if Ben Nye SK-1 (Cover-All Wheel) could cover this easily and quickly?

Also, is SK-1 (Cover-All) as pigmented as NK-1 (Conceal-All) or SK-11 (Tattoo Cover-All)? 

I only have access to SK-1 so I was wondering if it offers the same amount of coverage/pigmentation as the others, especially Tattoo Cover-All, or is it just the colors/shades that are different.

Thanks so much!   
Also, please feel free to share any tattoo stories with me...I love hearing about people's tattoos!",2021-03-02 23:51:24

I eventually had to throw it away once the lid broke off and I had no way of safely storing it, and I have not been able to find a lip gloss like it since (or at least I haven't found one that fits my budget, anyway). The closest match to this lip gloss that I can find is Lime Crime's Wet Cherry lip gloss in either the shade Tangy Cherry or Maraschino Cherry; however, I don't think either of those shades have sparkles and they aren't quite the same shade of red, not to mention that it is pretty expensive for me (I'm a broke college student).

Makeup,Looking for a Particular Estée Lauder Item. Can Anyone Identify?,"Hi All,
Yesterday I received an ad from Macy’s which showed an Estée Lauder Pure Color Envy lipstick as part of a free gift. However, this is not the normal Pure Color Envy packaging but has instead a [tropical/palm tree theme](https://imgur.com/a/gWW6o0q) on the tube.   

The ad did not give any other information as to whether this is a particular special edition or only available as the free gift, etc. I reached out to both Macy’s and Estée Lauder separately, but they just keep pointing me to the regular Pure Color Envy line. Since the free gift is only available in store and I am not shopping in-person because of the pandemic, I am unable to procure this item as a free gift, but would be willing to buy it outright if I could find it online. Does anyone know if this is some sort of special edition packaging/the name of it? Or any similarly themed items?

Thanks in advance to anyone who can point me in the right direction. Much appreciated.",2021-03-04 21:57:42

I’ve been getting pretty frustrated with liquid foundation. It seems like every trick I’ve tried just makes my makeup look worse. When I put my liquid foundation on, I use a beauty blender and dab. Depending on the day, my skin either ends up looking dry and crusty or the makeup looks like it’s not even sitting on my skin at all (oily and separated looking). My makeup is always either cakey from looking dry or cakey from looking oily and separated. I always exfoliate gently and moisturize before the makeup. I’ve tried a layer of translucent powder before the foundation, I’ve tried using oils to mix with my foundation, I’ve tried damp sponges and dry sponges, blending more seems to just rub my makeup all the way off, blending less leaves it looking cakey still.

👉 Revlon Photoready 'Prime Plus' Makeup + Skincare Primer 


First-Impression Review: really did give my skin a 'perfected' look, but left my hands both greasy AND sticky-feeling. It also has a really yuck scent, which went away, but wasn't pleasant. I do love the way it works, &amp; apparantly it has long-term use benefits.

👉 BH Cosmetics 'Naturally Flawless' Foundation 


First-Impression Review: annoying AF packaging - the pump didn't work at all, so had to pour out my desired amount. Luckily, it looked absolutely beautiful on my skin, so it had a saving-grace. I LOVE the coverage, the finish, &amp; the color-match. 


➡️ Shade: 209 Ivory Beige

🚦 Rating: B

......

👉 Hard Candy 'Marilyn Monroe' Loose Airy Powder 


First-Impression Review: feels like an HD powder, which did NOT excite me. However, it applied perfectly, &amp; set my foundation like a high-dollar powder. Absolutely no complaints about its performance. There is a 'sparkling strawberry' added-fragrance (which I personally REALLY enjoy). The only downside is that this little powder is SO messy, &amp; will literally get in places you have no intention of putting powder. 


➡️ Shade: Transluscent

💰 Price: $6.67

👉 Found 'Baked Illuminating' Blush 


First-Impression Review: I absolutely loved how this looks, how it works, &amp; the fact you get such a huge amount of blush in the pan. It does give a luminous glow, so if you aren't into that - you definitely won't like this. It also shows up more 'pink' than it appears in the pan.


➡️ Shade: 80 Rose Glow

💰 Price: $6.88 (Walmart)

🚦 Rating: A

......

👉 ELF Illuminating Palette 


First-Impression Review: high-hopes for this palette that were totally let down. It does NOT give you the sought-after glow that many seek - but it's quite dim &amp; soft. I am giving it an average rating, because for 'everyday' wear, I like something a little more shiny, but I truly believe there is a place in my collection for this. There ARE occasions where I don't want it to look like I'm wearing any highlight, &amp; this would be perfect for that. 


➡️ Shade: All Mixed Together

💰 Price: $8.00 (price varies w/ retailer)

🚦 Rating: C

👉 BPerfect Cosmetics x Stacey Marie 'Carnival Palette' 


First-Impression Review: I've waited seemingly forever for this palette, &amp; it was such an experience using it for the first time. It was even better than I hoped it would be. The colors are beautiful. The shimmers are high-shine, &amp; the mattes pull contrast. There is a huge selection of color options to create so many looks!

Foundation often comes off if I wear it because I have combination skin, I have some stupidly oily parts and some stupidly dry parts.

Makeup,I want to learn basic make up. But i dont know where to start.,"So, I have always wanted to try out a lot of different makeup. But I never got the chance because my family (Mum and Sister) is not into make up.  Also because I am a transgirl.  I am very insecure and have a lot of issues and as a result, I never gave makeup a shot, mainly out of the fear of being laughed at.  Recently, I have taken an initiative to try out new things  and to work on myself in an effort to improve my mental health . 

\*I am a brown girl.(IDK, it might be an important fact)

I don't have a lot of money to spend on cosmetics as of now. So, Here is what I have in mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to learn a very easy and basic gothic eye makeup that stands between basic and extreme. It should be something i could wear to college. 

The look  I was considering is something like a redish base coat that fades into the black. You probably already figured out the look I am talking about. It a common goth look. 

How do I go about achieving that look?

What are the cosmetics I will need?

And if any creator is watching can you please make a tutorial on the same for a beginner.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I have figured, I will need a concealer, eyeliner, kohl, black and red eye shadow, Brushes and tape. 

is this how i should go about doing this?

First apply the concealer on my upper and lower eyelids. Then apply the red eye shadow. Then apply the eyeliner and mix it with the red eye shadow and then blend it with black eye shadow. Should that be enough? Am I missing something?

Makeup,Eyelashes stopped curling?,"I used to use this crappy little metal eyelash curler with no rubber pad on it - it curled my eyelashes perfectly fine for 7 years. It finally broke a while back, so I replaced it with the ELF one.

Since I've replaced it, I noticed that my eyelashes hold a curl for about 10 seconds. By the time I get my mascara on, they're sticking straight forward. I tried waterproof mascara because I read it holds a curl better, but that didn't seem to make any difference. 

Has anyone else encountered this/have a solution? I'm about to take the rubber pad off the ELF one and see if it works that way, but I know that squeezing your eyelid between two pieces of metal probably isn't ideal.

Makeup,"Eyeshadow application: do y’all prefer to apply shadows from lightest to darkest, or the other way around?","Long time lurker of this subreddit, but figured i’d get some opinions on a question i’ve had for a while. 

I grew up watching makeup gurus, like Jaclyn Hill, Makeup Geek, etc. i remember they’d always start off their eyeshadow looks with a light, transition shade and gradually go in with darker shades. I’ve seen tutorials where people will pack the *darkest* color first, then blend it out with lighter colors. Both methods seem to always produce flawless results. 

I want to get better at eyeshadow, but pigmentation and muddiness is always an issue for me. If i start with light shades, my eyeshadow isn’t as pigmented as i’d like it to be. If i start with dark shades, i feel like my shadows get “lost” with blending, and it can be muddy. I know it’s not an issue with my primer or brushes, since i have pretty good ones to work with.

She already has an excellent skin care routine, she just gets dry spots on her face from Lupus. We also used the No Poreblem Primer. We tried brushes and a makeup sponge. Are we applying is wrong or does it have to do with the foundation itself? Any suggestions would be appreciated!",2021-03-10 03:13:51

Makeup,Help- Have not worn makeup in a year. Need help find replacements for discontinued stuff.,"Please help! I have been working remotely for a year now, and just stopped wearing makeup this whole year. Some of my makeup was close to needing replacement before COVID, so I have no clue what to order as a replacement now a lot of those things are discontinued. Now that I need to start going back into the office, I'm lost and overwhelmed. 

My details: Skin tone- Usually the lightest color- Porcelain (I burn or get occasional freckles, but I've never tanned. SPF is my friend!); Eye color- Green/Blue depends on what I'm wearing; Hair- Medium brown; Age- newly in the 40s; Color palette: Natural looks (Cool or Neutral colors. Yellow hues make me look sick.)

What I need help replacing:

\- Laura Geller's Luminous Veil Cream foundation stick: I just need a foundation to touch up and even areas out. This stuff was great at just spreading a little where I needed it. It also did not melt or sweet off in humidity or heat, which is a constant here from May-September.

\- Eyeshadow: My eyeshadow was so old the label is unreadable and it didn't seem to last in humidity, so I'm open to suggestions. I need non-glitter color palettes in cool/neutral colors. I'm open to suggestions of creams or powders.",2021-03-10 04:38:58

Makeup,"Lip Stain: water-based ""markers"", like Covergirl Outlast?","I love lip stains that are buildable, water-based and that actually ""stain"" or pigment lips for an extended period.

My favorite ever has been the Covergirl Outlast lip stain ""markers"", because of the consistency of the product, that you can apply the stain very precisely to your lips, and that it actually provides a sort of temporary, natural-looking ""dye"" to lips.

Most ""lip stains"" that I come across are more like long-wear lipsticks in that the pigment doesn't sink into your lip skin; instead, it sits on top. 

Has anyone found anything similar to the Covergirl Outlast line? Or any other lip stains that are truly just water-based ""dyes"" to apply to the lips?",2021-03-10 05:11:45

Here are some I tried and don’t like.

Maybelline Age Rewind in Cool Ivory and Fair- washed me out. too light and way too dark.

Maybelline Fit Me Concealer in Cool Ivory and Fair-washed me out. too light and way too dark.

Elf Hydrating Camo Concealer in Fair Rose- way too dark. not for fair skinned at all!

Glossier Stretch Concealer in G12- too dark. looked peachy.

Nyx Can’t Stop Won’t Stop Concealer in Pale- too dark. looked yellow.

Should I go for higher end concealer? like ILIA, NARS concealer, BECCA under eye brightening concealer etc.

I’ve tried different foundations but recently I’m mixing Clinique with a little bit of Nyx to get a good shade match. I use a moisturizer and a primer beforehand. I set the foundation with a little powder before using blush or bronzer. And finish with a setting spray. The foundation starts looking bad before I put any powder on and the more stuff I put on my face after that, it just looks dry and gross.

Makeup,Blush &amp; Highlight on Nose💄,"Hi, I’m sitting here on my lunch break right now, and I was just thinking about buying the (super cute) Kaja blush from Sephora. Had a random question about both blush + highlight that was on my mind
that I wanted to share.

How common is it for you to see people with blush and highlight on their nose, out in public? 
Like highlight on bridge and tip of the nose, and the blush is also peeking through under the highlight, if that makes sense!

I’m asking cause I totally love it and I think it’s a top tier makeup move (my opinion though!) Something about the blush + highlight combo that makes me fall in love with it!
Highlight on the cheekbones too! But I haven’t been doing it on the cheekbones cause I’ve been obsessed with blush lately.

Anyways, as an avid wearer, I don’t think I’ve actually seen a lot of people adding blush + highlight on their nose or maybe it’s just more subtle? But then again, everyone’s wearing masks where I live, so I can’t even tell if someone did have it on! 

Just wanted to see if it’s actually a common makeup routine that people do. You know, aside from only seeing it on TikTok, since it’s pretty common there. Thanks! :)",2021-03-12 04:03:14

I wish to cover up JUST the mole for videos I will be doing, so I want to account for extreme lighting I guess? not sure if that's a thing

also the above photo is not me, I'm a man you see and i've not used makeup save for one or 2 instances in the past, so please use brand and type and names or anything ill need to find it

another thing i'm of darker asian complexion, is this something I can get right buying from online if not which shop sells make up (UK/London based)

overall a simple/single method if possible please if not whichever would work the best please

I've tried everything I can think of over the last few months, from different brushes, foundations, skincare, primers and it always seems to end with the same result. It's bad from the moment its applied but does get worse as the day goes on.

I thought I had it figured out, along with proper skincare I bought Skinbase and Hydraveil from Illamasqua thinking I'd be onto a winner. It's somehow worse. To be honest the last foundation that actually looked good on my skin was Elizabeth Arden, the cream foundation that came with the sponge in the 00s haha. But i've never had a good coverage that doesnt leave a terrible texture since.

Makeup,Setting powder for dry skin,"Whats a good setting powder for dry skin? I typically only wear cream products because I like the way it looks on my skin and I prefer the natural/glowy look it gives me. 

I also use Kora organics noni radiant eye oil instead of a typical eye cream so I feel like with that and my cream and liquid makeup it’s almost too much glow. Hopefully using a setting powder will also help my eyeshadow to stay put better and longer. 

I’m looking for a setting powder to use only around the eye area. Preferably something translucent.  Right now I’m pretty fair. I used to self tan a lot before I had my baby and will start self tanning again eventually when I find the time lol. So something that works for fair and tan skin. 

Hate the cakey powdery look. Really trying to avoid that. I’d rather not wear any setting powder if it ends up looking like that. 

Also a huge bonus if the packaging isn’t messy. I like the idea of pressed powders but I feel like there are way more loose powder options.

So I’m not a big makeup girl and I’ve been to a couple of full face make up sessions and honestly every time I felt and looked ridiculous. Even my family and SO said that the make up didn’t really work which is similar to how I felt. I’ve tried a couple of different girls to do the make up so I’m fairly certain it wasn’t them. Anyway my question here is; is there really such a thing as just not having a face for make up? Or could it be that I’m just not used to it? If it matters I had tried the full glam fox eye look as well as the cat and both just felt super cakey and made me look like a goofy version of myself. Also when I saw my skin in natural light it looked much darker than it was. I looked very orange and those trendy fluffy brows just looked like two hella overweight caterpillars on my eyes. 


Also added to that is it possible to maybe add eye make up(eye liners and shadows) without foundation and bronzers and stuff?

Makeup,"Very confused. Do I match foundation with my neck, my chest, wrist or face?","Hi all! I'm a makeup newbie and I am on mobile so sorry for any formatting problems.

I'm trying to get into make up but I'm having trouble understanding what I'm supposed to match with. My face is darker than my neck and my neck is darker than my chest because I usually stay covered in the sun. To top it off I'm a light olive so finding matches has been fun.

I also read you should use foundation that is lighter than your neck because  bronzing and contouring will darken it, but I'm not interested at all in bronzing or contour. I want to keep a makeup routine as minimal as possible.

Makeup,January - Favorites!,"🏅 These Are My January 2021 Favorites! 🗓 

......

➡️ NOTE: This is MY opinion &amp; experience; regarding the product quality. As always, use/buy the makeup that makes YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun.

......

📌 La Mer Micellar Water 

▪️ Why: I save this for best, &amp; boy - does it give an experience! The fragrance is soothing &amp; spa-like, &amp; the 'feel' of the product is absolutely refreshing. I'm almost out, &amp; will definitely splurge on another one because it literally brings me joy. 

💰 Price: $95.00

......

📌 Colgate Whitening Liquid Toothpaste 

▪️ Why: I'm really big into dental hygiene, &amp; I keep about 5 or 6 toothpastes in circulation, so I never get bored. I just got this one last month, &amp; it's wonderful! It cleans so well, gives me bright teeth, &amp; keeps my breath fresh. Highly recommend. 

👅 Flavor: Crystal Mint

💰 Price: $1.00

......

📌 Glossier Stretch Concealer 

▪️ Why: I used this for my 'Shop My Stash' this month, &amp; I legitimately cannot get enough. It looks SO good under my eyes, which are prone to definite creasing &amp; dryness. Not with this concealer! Plus a little goes a long, long way, so the money is well-spent. It plays well with skincare, foundation, AND powder. I love it. 

🕶 Shade: G12

💰 Price: $18.00

......

📌 ELF Blush/Bronzer Duo 

▪️ Why: Definitely here for the bronzer. The blush isn't that great, but it's worth the money JUST for the bronzer. It's absolutely gorgeous on the skin. It shows up, it's blendable, it builds, &amp; the shade is perfection. It's just a bonus that you get a blush, too. 

🕶 Shade: St. Lucia

💰 Price: $4.00

......

📌 Hourglass Arch Brow Micro Pencil 

▪️ Why: During my 'First Impressions', I wasn't SO stoked about it, but having used it every day for a month, I found that I've seen the light. The shape of this pencil just works. I typically use 3 products in my brows (the picture ONLY shows the pencil), but I'm just so amazed at how well it outlines, fills in patches, &amp; builds - all without being waxy. It's a definite win. 

🕶 Shade: Blonde

💰 Price: $28.00

......

📌 Half Caked Liquid Lipsticks 

▪️ Why: Can I just say, 'Wow'? These are the BEST Liquid lips I've used up until this point in my life. They are creamy, comfortable, bold, non-transferable, smell great, &amp; long-lasting. I also dig the shape of the applicator, because it allows you the precision to line your lips with the same product. It also has a small dip in it, so it maintains enough lipstick on the wand to reduce the amount of dips. These are just simply stunning. 

🕶 Shade: Theme Song, Low Key, '82 Bordeaux

💰 Price: $12.00/each",2021-02-01 04:12:48
Makeup,Favorite eyeshadow brush?,"I usually use one matte color for eyeshadow, occasionally I’ll throw in a shimmery pop in the inner corner or in the center of my lid.  I’d like to find a brush that blends evenly over my entire lid and doesn’t leave the edges looking splotchy.

Makeup,I will not give Sephora my money any more. RE: Insider Points,"I'm 35 years old and have been a Sephora Beauty Insider for over a decade.  Today I logged into my account on their site to make a purchase and was shocked that my points was ZERO.  I scrolled down to find out that since I have been inactive for 12 months, my 957 points I carefully accumulated over the years have EXPIRED Jan 1,2021! Can not be used.

I called their customer service who read a script that there was nothing they could do to reinstate the points.  I did not receive any emails or warnings about this expiration.   We are in a pandemic and I have not been to my beloved Garden State Plaza (NJ) shopping mall since February 2020.  I didn't even redeem my birthday rewards this year which was a total first for me. Today I went to make a purchase and this is what I find.   I am extremely disappointed in Sephora and will no longer be giving them my money.

&amp;#x200B;

\*edit\* Thank you for telling me to call &amp; try again! I called back and the customer service rep had a record of my previous call and said, ""I see you just called earlier today about this...there is still nothing we can do.""

Makeup,eyeshadow frustration,"hey guys and gals

since coming off of birth control 2 years ago, my skin has been acting crazy. The worst area is my eyes with my under eye area being extremely dry while my lids have become CRAZY oily.

while I was still on BC, eyeshadow would last all day on me. Now even after applying primers and adding a setting spray once I'm finished, my shadow will be completely gone within a good hour or so.

I'm super frustrated about this. The only brand somewhat lasting on my eyes is Charlotte tilbury, but I have so many old palettes I wanna use again :( do any of you have some advice on what to do? the shadow will stay on close to my lashline, but on my lids and crease it just disappears within what feels like minutes. When I was still on BC, even the poorest quality drugstore palettes would stay for what felt like ages.. 

Help this frustrated gal out please :(

Makeup,Do you have to pay for Morphe returns?,"I purchased some hydra liners and a couple of makeup brushes from morphe, I immediately realized I bought the wrong brush and contacted them ~10 seconds after checkout to get the order cancelled.

I always ALWAYS read return policies before ordering from some place new and nowhere on Morphe’s website does it say that the consumer is supposed to pay for return shipping. It says to contact them, kind of like Glossier, so I did and all they did was send me an address???",2021-02-02 12:41:26

Makeup,"Hey, I'm just starting out doing makeup and I would love to hear some tips and tricks","I'm a 17-year-old male and I've recently started liking doing make-up and I really want to get into it...

I'm from a really conservative family so I don't get a lot of time to practice it (I only get to practice it when my parents are out shopping/for an event or something) so I really need help learning things fast and simple... my mom has a bunch of makeup items since she's in the makeup industry so the products aren't a big deal, but I don't know what each product is, and what it does and how it's used... the most I know is foundation and lipstick, that's all...

So please give me some tips and tricks and methods of make-up I could practice and learn over time, and also help me look prettier! I don't wear make-up outside the house of course, so that's not a big deal...

I'm kind of new to the whole make-up/skin care routine type of deal and I want to 'level up' my knowlegde. As my skin is showing aging,   


One thing I'm struggling with is my blue circles around my eyes. (it's almost gone full circle ...)  
Anyway, I know this is genetic and nothing much can be done about it but i'm looking for a good BB cream under eyes. I've used the Maybeline roll on but it irritates my eyelids after a week of usage. It also begins to get 'cakey'.. I don't know if this is due to my dry skin around my eyes or because I'm not using a primer...  


I'm not a big fan of using a creme to let the other creme do it's thing (seems a little redundant)   
Is there a good BB cream for under the eyes for dry skin or is it maybe because I'm skipping on a crucial step like a primer ?",2021-02-02 18:14:10

For reference:

Cool tones are too pink, warm tones are too yellow and neutral is too orange/peachy. 
My veins are blue and green
I tan easily but mostly pale because there’s very little sun where I live but during the summer I never burn
I look equally fine in silver and gold jewelry

Makeup,"""Makeup is for ugly girls""","(Trying to feel good about some smudged eyeliner and mascara today)--&gt; https://imgur.com/a/YQVBaKM

I'm uncovering so many layers of judgement I've internalized from childhood/teen years, and remembered these gems:

""Makeup is for ugly girls."" My dad would tell me...

""Really?? "" My mom said rolling her eyes at me for putting on (clear!) mascara when I was 12

""Natural is best"" 

""You look like a clown"" My sister said to me when I snuck eyeliner (I'd stolen) to school to put on in the girls bathroom. 


× I am 27 now and wanting to learn to wear makeup for the first time(for empowerment and self love).

 I realized recently how much I avoid looking in the mirror, when my husband showed me a picture of myself he photoshoped with blonde hair (I wanted to see what it would be like if I could bring myself to get my first professional haircut and color) I recoiled and tears were in my eyes. ""Wow I thought it was cute."" He said . Then I realized it's my face I couldn't even see the hair somehow..., I have such a hard time looking at myself, I don't feel like the face in the mirror is me. I wear loose clothes and no makeup all the time and assumed it was due to being a hippie natural type but really now I'm tired of it. I feel infantalized , I know it's not just ""being natural"" there is something alot more insidious going on. I've always been ""cute"" but that's it I want to feel like a woman not the dumb kid I feel like. I want to feel sexy... I'm too shy to even say the word sexy out loud. 


××
I've gotten stuck with shadows of shame , guilt , and ""feeling silly"" about doing anything to care for myself. I think makeup or no makeup on other girls is totally beautiful and I seem to only reserve this hate and judgement for myself. The cynical voice tells me I'm wasting my time, but I'm not taking that for an answer anymore. I'm tired of living in the shadow of who I could be.",2021-02-03 12:53:49

I live in the EU (Denmark) and would love to keep ordering from them, but am a little worried about doing so. 

On their website it says: “ The UK left the European Union on the 1st of January 2021. To keep things nice and simple for our EU customers, we've adjusted our pricing so the price displayed at checkout will be the final price you pay. Please be sure to check the correct shipping country is selected when on site, to view the correct prices.”

Makeup,Patchiness and creasing while trying to apply and blend bright blue/purple/green etc. eyeshadow shades - How to prevent this?,"I don’t know about you guys, but for me, when it comes to bright warm toned eyeshadow shades (I.e. bright yellows, oranges, reds, pinks, etc.) they’re always so easy to pack onto the eye and blend. However, bright blues, purples, and green type shades are ALWAYS a bit of a struggle for me.

When I do blues/purples/etc., I usually try to start with a light transition shade and then add layers to darken it, which typically works decently, but then when I want a lot of pigment to a certain area (like on my outer V for example), I go in to pack on the shade, and it seems like no matter WHAT, it creases or doesn’t blend well, even after going back in with a clean blending brush or trying to blend it with lighter shades. 

Does anyone have the same issue or know why this is? What do you do to prevent it? I’ve had this issue with both higher end and drugstore brand eyeshadows. I usually use Tarte Shapetape concealer as a primer for bright eyeshadows, but I’m wondering if it’s the primer I’m using, my application/blending technique, or if it’s just practically inevitable?

TL;DR: I always have issues with creasing and patchiness when it comes to blending bright blue, purple and green eyeshadow shades. Any advice on how to prevent this or why this may be? Thanks in advance. ❤️",2021-02-04 00:04:50

I can tell the undertones of foundations - cool/pink, warm, etc. I’ve just always had a hard time buying a foundation that fits my skin color (all were drugstore though). Like literally the only thing that was a perfect match was a foundation that I got matched at Sephora. 

Today I FINALLY had a perfect match from the drugstore. It’s the Maybelline Dream Radiant Liquid in Sandy Beige. I’ve been trying to train my eyes to spot out good match foundations with reference from the 1 foundation that fits me. The foundation is the Bareminerals Pro Longwear Foundation in Butterscotch 15.5 (it’s a powder) and Sephora describes it as a medium neutral with peach undertones. I always thought I was a neutral undertone but sometimes neutral foundations are a tad too pink for me while the warmer undertones were too yellow/dark. 

I’m just really glad I finally got it right for a drugstore foundation because I thought I could never try drugstore foundations with the luck I’ve had.

Or, go full coverage and look really dry with just bad quality skin. I have tired every allegedly hydrating foundation there is. Light coverage ones up to full full coverage. I still look dry with bad skin wearing foundation. I hate that I can't even my skin tone AND have moisturized skin. With zero makeup my skin is hydrated and fine. But the melasma is there of course.

Makeup,Need Help Finding Brand,"I know this is a long shot but it is really going to bother me.

The other day I was scrolling on Instagram and I was caught up so it was showing me people I don't follow. I came across a person who was doing something makeup related. Clicked on her page and scrolled a bit and saw this really incredible prismatic swatches. Went to the brand page and then their site... A lot of the site was sold out. 

I left Instagram and when I went back it was all gone. The brand and every trace of how I got there. I can't stop thinking about this collection though, and more importantly it will just bother me if I never find it.

At some point I definitely saw that the brand was out of the West Coast of the US - could be Oregon? The branch name definitely had a D in it. The palette was maybe six-seven prismatic shadows and like $96? Somewhere around there. They did have single shadows that were in the $8-$14 range - lots of greens, blues, purples, etc. When I say ""lots"" I mean that generously - it was a smaller brand, for sure...

I think they had eye makeup and maybe skin care? But I didn't click on that so I'm not sure what was involved there.

Any advice, tips, websites would be greatly appreciated. I have kind of big blue eyes, so naturally my best face feature. Lips are small and thin, I hate them.

Makeup,Hating my face with makeup on??,"I feel like its v common for people to dislike their appearance when not wearing makeup. My problem seems stupid, even to me but let me explain:
Since I was a pre teen I have loved to experiment with makeup. I wanted to become a makeup artist at one point. I didn't have a problem going out without it, I liked to both just go bare faced with a sweatshirt or with a heavy smoky eye. Recently whenever I try to put on makeup it makes me hate my face. I feel like I look weird with it. It makes me upset because I used to be so confident with my femininity but now I apply eyeshadow, look in the mirror and feel ugly.

Makeup,Best makeup (foundation/bb cream) for oily and dry skin? Most either cakes or makes me break out like crazy,"I have both very oily and very dry skin that I can manage very well when I don't wear makeup. The issue when I wear makeup, after wearing for a few hours are as follows:

1. Gets weird and cakey/gunky from oil;
2. Drys my face out to an extreme (every with strong moisturizers); or
3. If it doesn't do the above, but it makes me break out really bad.

I have had the best luck with Tarte's water foundation combined with Smashbox Photo Finish primer, with an oil absorbing powder -- can do well to about mid afternoon. The issue I have is how heavy it feels.

Makeup,How do people wear lashes every single day??????,"I don't mean in a rhetorical way like ""they must be so uncomfortable!"" I mean literally HOW do people do it. 

I'm not that into makeup, all I really do is a strong wing liner and maybe some lip tint if I remember to put it on (I usually don't) and I feel like that's enough to pull my face together. I don't even wear mascara. But these days I've been wanting to try something different, and on top of that I've been getting comments that my eyeliner is a bit much (I really don't think it is) or that some lashes would really be all I need to get my look together. 

The only thing is is that I don't want to buy a pair of lashes and fall in love with them and then keep having to spend and spend on them, so how are people able to wear lashes everyday? Do you just keep buying them? Do you get magnetic/reusable ones? Is there a way to save them?

Makeup,"Older, new to makeup, and totally lost... please help.","I just turned 43 years old and have not worn makeup in almost 3 years. In fact, a month ago I finally threw away all the makeup I had because it was old and I vowed to never wear makeup again. I was never in to it. I always thought I had decent skin and looked just fine without it.

However, I started to notice that my skin is changing. It probably had been for years but something about turning 43 and having some aches and pain I just noticed that I am aging. OMG. I honestly don't mind for the most part.

But I noticed that I have started developing spider veins on my chin and around my nose. My eyelids are hooded and sort of droopy. And I have combination skin with redness in areas. I bet I have had it for a long time, but I'm suddenly bothered by it. It suddenly is making me feel old and unattractive.

I have fair skin (burn easily, lots of freckles) and like natural/neutral tones. When I did use makeup I didn't really use mascara or eyeliner because I felt like I could never get it off. And foundation always felt like my skin was cakey. I am sure I wasn't using the right or good products. At least that it what I am assuming.

With that said, perhaps it is time to dabble in skin care and makeup again. But there is so much advice and products and it is honestly overwhelming. And I don't want to spend too much money to start.

Do you lovely people have advice on where to start? Perhaps youtubers to watch? Products to try? Things to not do?

I was sort of thinking of trying the ISPY subscription because it seems like an affordable way to try different things.

Thank you for any advice and suggestions. Here's to a beautiful 2021.",2021-01-01 10:53:27

a dewy hydrating one or a matte one?

Makeup,Is it impossible for foundation to look good with acne scars?,"TLDR; Foundation separates on me the second I apply it and I’ve tried every trick in the book. Could high end foundation help? Or is it something else? 


I’ve recently started being a bit more insecure about my skin (It’s exam season and the stress is wreaking havoc) so I’ve been trying to wear foundation more. The only foundations I’ve tried are Maybelline Superstay, another random Maybelline one and a Clinique one when I was younger. 

My problem is, my foundation separates really badly around any fresh acne scars and on my forehead. I have normal-dry skin and I’ve tried priming and moisturising beforehand, or using a heavy night cream the night before. I’ve tried mixing oil into my foundation, I’ve tried brushes and sponges, and I exfoliate weekly with the Paula’s choice BHA (anymore and my skin gets too dry and peels). It looks the worst on my forehead even though I don’t have any active acne there but it looks incredibly cakey and separates horribly. It’s not even a case of it looking bad after a few hours, I can spend several minutes blending but it will look terrible straight away. 

I’m wondering if this is just a case of drugstore foundation not working so I bought the Nars sheer glow yesterday to see if that might make a difference but I’m not very hopeful. Could there be something I’m missing?",2021-01-02 11:53:14
Makeup,Eyeliner for hooded eyes?,"Hey guys! I’m a Caucasian girl, but I have super hooded eyes, to the point where I get asked if I am half asian all the time. I work as a makeup artist in film and television so I know alllll the good products. The one thing I still cannot find a “holy grail” for, is liquid liner that doesn’t transfer. I’m starting to think my best bet would be to try some liners from Asia? As they are catered more towards people with hooded eyes. I wear liquid liner almost every day, and it’s so annoying having to get rid of the transfer line on my lid all the time. Please tell me what has worked for you guys 🙏🏻",2021-01-02 12:04:04

A good grooming regimen can be exhausting, but until you guys get the hint, it keeps repeating. Finding a few of the right products and then actually using ’em is always a solid move, an investment in your personal appearance well-worth the effort involved. Proper beard care requires a little extra grooming and maintenance, and that means using [good quality products like beard shampoos and conditioners](https://www.styleinmood.com/10-best-beard-shampoos-and-conditioners-for-men-in-2021/). After all, keeping a clean beard is critical to growing long, full facial hair.

If you’re lucky enough to have a chin equipped with luscious, thick hair, you’ll also need to put the effort in to keep it clean. Since beard hair is thicker than regular hair, regular shampoo simply won’t do.",2021-01-02 15:55:54

Makeup,Broken glass found inside makeup bottle,"Omgosh! I've used Juice Beauty flawless foundation for the past couple of years now. The most recent bottle I purchased online at Ulta. I was near finishing off my bottle of the foundation and the pump was no longer releasing any product. So, I unscrewed the cap so I could pour out some of the remainder into my hand. 
Something hard and jagged tumbled down toward the opening as I tried to pour some product out. I was mortified to see that it was a large piece of glass! Shards of glass were even on my fingers mixed in with the foundation. I had been using it like this for the past several months! I think I may have found the culprit for what is causing my cheeks to be rough these past few months. I'm horrified to think I was rubbing tiny glass shards into my face.. 

I wasn't sure if I need to contact Juice Beauty or Ulta about this. Who do you think is to blame? Has anyone experienced something like this? 

I figured Juice Beauty was to blame; I suspect it must have happened during manufacturing. I have no clue how a break in the glass could possibly occur in the inside. The bottle looks perfectly intact on the outside. I saved the container with the jagged piece of glass still in it for evidence. I'm shocked a product with such a defect could be put on the shelf!! I hope my face doesn't have tiny glass shards stuck in it because I've noticed my cheeks develop some roughness... 😔",2021-01-02 21:26:11

One thing I've noticed is that I've never really tried contour. I feel like that might help a lot with the face shape problem which might also help with the resting bitch face? Feels like make up makes my whole face drag downwards, would contour and/or highlighter help ""lift"" the correct places? Or maybe the problem is something else?

Makeup,[Review] Natasha Denona - Tropic Palette Review,"✅ New Saturday Palette Review 

Natasha Denona - Tropic Palette ✌

👁 Look Created: Full Cut-Crease (look is in profile if you wanted to see it)

⚫ Packaging: each pan sizes is 1.5g, azure-blue hard plastic packaging, magnetic closure, medium rectangle shape, mirror inside, pans are removable from the back, shade names are printed below each shadow

⚫ Country of Origin: Italy

⚫ # of Shades in Palette: 15

⚫ Formulas Included: 4 formulas (10 creamy mattes, 3 sparkling, 1 metallics, 1 duochrome)

⚫ Designation: warm-toned neutral meets a pop of vibrancy

⚫ Type of Press: moderate-press - lots of kickback in pan, slight fallout on my face

⚫ Extra Information: paraben-free, each vertical row was designed to be a specific 'look', cruelty-free, limited edition from Spring/Summer 2018

💰 Price: $129.00
💲 Price/Shadow: $8.60

🔎 Review: This palette is so fun, because you can do an everyday 'neutral' look, or kick it up a notch with some color. For me, everything performed SO well - there was 0 patchiness with any shades that I used. The blendability between shades was amazing, and very, very easy. I did have some fallout, particularly from 'Laguna', but none of the neutrals. I really like the shade variance in this palette- you have a nice array of light, mid, and deep tones to create a full depth look. I actually really like this palette, and if you have it - recommend it for daily wear or a special event.

Makeup,**help and advice needed**,"Sorry about the long post, but I'm desperate 

 I am at a loss and am so, so, so very tired of spending $30+ per  bottle of foundation that just doesn't work. I am about to move onto my 4th try of expensive foundation and would rather spend money like that on better things (like shoes....or ya know....bills lol)

I have acne prone/ scarred/ textured/mostly oily with a little bit of dry skin. Each morning I cleanse, moisturize, give time for moisturizer to dry, then prime before foundation. I let the primer set for 5+ min (however long it takes me to brush teeth and deal with my hair) before foundation, let set for a few minutes before setting powder. I use products for combination skin and am scared to use ones for dry skin. 

By the end of the day my foundation settles into my scars, leaving these little light flakey patches. No matter what foundation I've used, 2 faced born this way, urban decay, benefit hello happy, each one does this. The only foundation that has truly matched my skin the best has been the benefit hello happy, but its been the WORST with the dry flakey patches and cakes up so mush in my smile lines (I'm 30, its a thing, they exist, and I'm just *thrilled* they're there)

I'm super frustrated and just need to know what to do. Last time I was in ulta, I explained all of this to the girl working there, she recommended benefit hello happy....again best color match WORST one I've used yet, it basically settles in the scars but slides right off everywhere else.

Makeup,Eyeshadow advice for prominent eyes?,"Hi. I really like glitters and shimmery stuff and weird colors and I fall for it every time I see a shiny new palette come out, just to try it, get discouraged, and stick it on the shelf to become a decoration instead.
I have huuuge eyes and not much for eyebrows -- I used to compulsively pick at them, just assume they're gone. When i paint them on, I know I don't go big enough, but I can't seem to get that right either.

Dark eyeshadow feels weird on me but it could just be a comfort zone thing. I am very very pale, with either cool or neutral skin tone, and my eyes are this weird shade of blue. Like dark blue, think of a standard blue crayola marker -- that's me. I'd like them if I knew WTF to do with them without looking like a maniac. Greys and Blacks either look very bad on me or I am very bad at them. Browns hit or miss it seems.

Should I give up on fun eyeshadow? Does anyone have any advice on making prominent/giant eyes look smaller?

Makeup,Liquid lip version of Mac’s ‘Russian Red’,"I recently fell in love with Mac’s Russian Red lipstick. 

The only problem is Mac doesn’t make a liquid lip version. I would love to have one since I find my self constantly having to reapply my current lipstick. I also tend to prefer lipstick lips over cream lipsticks.

Does anyone know of a liquid lipstick that has a very similar shade to Russian Red? It can be any brand.

Makeup,Best products for dry/acne prone skin!?,"Hey everyone ! Just wondering if anyone has any suggestions or recommendations on products (foundations, concealers, primers, contour/highlighting products, etc) that are good for BOTH dry AND acne prone skin? I have a lot of problems finding the right products because I have to take both my dryness and acne into consideration. I know a lot of products that are good for dryness, but they make me break out, or stuff that’s good for acne but then those products dry me out. I currently use the ulta cream foundation stick and L’Oréal liquid concealer and the nyx contour stick. I also sometimes use Lancôme powder foundation. None of these products break me out but no matter what I do or how I apply stuff, I still find my skin looking dry and flaky in my t zone and on my chin. I always moisturize my face before hand but I still always look dry after applying make up even without powder products. Any suggestions or advice would be much appreciated.

Makeup,eyeshadow primers/bases,"I've been trying to get into makeup this year especially bright and colorful eyeshadow looks. I've been having trouble finding a good eye base/primer. I always thought they were the same thing but they actually aren't. the most popular base I've seen is the PLouise eye base but the shipping to Canada is insane for me and I can't figure out how the color system for eye bases works. I've been using some random concealer that I found as an eye base and it works well, but then I read that conclear doesn't work well as an eye base.  but I also read that using a mattifying concealer makes a good eye base as you won't have to set it with powder or anything. another good eye base I've seen is the urban decay one. any thoughts on that? and also the ABH eye base, but I have read that it doesn't spread easily, dries up because you can get to work and eyeshadow still cracks anyway. I also recently purchase the elf 16 hr camo concealer because read that it works as a good eyeshadow base because it is matte 

so basically I need a good eye base: here are some that I've seen that are worth so drop your opinions on them:

\-plouise eye base

\-urban decay eye base

\-ABH eye primer

\-Covergirl eye primer

if you can make out the ten questions I asked, as a tip my skin is on the darker side. drop your opinion on these eyeshadow bases and any others that you would recommend.",2021-01-04 18:14:05

I am looking for a recommandation for a good blond brow pencil.
It is very difficult to find a good one, because there are often too « yellow » , and it doesnt fit me well.

Currently, i am using two products by Anastasia Beverly hills :
- « the dipbrow pommade » in « blonde ». I am very satisfied with this product because it gives thickness to my eyebrows and the color is perfect for me.
- « the perfect brow pencil » in « blonde », the color matches perfectly with my brows but the pencil melts too quickly, I have to re-sharpen the lead all the time! It's expensive because it won't last long...
Any advice or recommandations to replace my pencil ?

Makeup,Foundation allergy????,"Hey! So I love makeup. How it looks, the artistic processes, etc

I’ve tried on and off for years to start, but every time I do I have.... problems. I don’t know if it’s an allergy or if there’s just something wrong with me, but all of the foundations I have ever tried cause issues. I’ve had so many people try to tell me it can’t possible be the makeup, but the foundation is the only common factor in these incidents.

- Sinus headaches (yes, I’m positive it’s related to the foundation. Yes I’m positive it’s my sinuses. Yes it lasts the whole time and several hours, if not a whole day, later)

- Runny nose

- Watery, red eyes

- Puffy skin

- Sinus inflammation (Yes I’m sure.)

- Oil. Like a lot. Like it feels like the makeup is melting.

- For the next several days up to a week after I stop my skin will go through a bizarre cycle involving serious dryness, ridiculous oil production, redness, sensitivity, and shininess, before coming back to normal.

The sinus headaches, inflammation, and melting feeling are what people try to tell me “can’t possibly be the makeup” and “is all in my head”. I get these headaches when wearing foundation and when I have a sinus infection. Yes I’m positive that I have not coincidentally been sick every single time I’ve worn foundation since fourth grade up through now, in my 20s. I’m 99% sure I should not feel like Clinique and MAC are melting off my face, even in liquid form. Even the powdered ones felt like that to some extent. Maybe it’s the oil production?

I like how I look and get hyped and confident and then I can’t even enjoy it for more than a couple hours because I feel miserable. I want to look nice and feel pretty, but not at such a high cost of comfort.

I’ve tried liquid, cream stick, and powder. 

I’ve tried many different brands, admittedly a few “drugstore” ones, but I’ve also tried M.A.C., L’Oréal, and Clinique. People keep pointing me towards Clinique because it’s good for sensitive skin, but if it’s an allergy does that matter?

“Maybe it’s the eyeshadow?” “The mascara!”

Nope. I don’t have a mica allergy. I rarely wear mascara even when doing makeup, and when I do it by itself it’s fine. Same for the eyeshadow. Lipstick, lipgloss, and blush too. Color corrector felt fine the one time I tried it, up until I put the foundation on. Eyeliner. Lip liner. Liquid cream pencil powder. Shiny glittery matte waterproof not waterproof. All of it’s fine!

And finally, I’ve tried wearing nothing but foundation. That causes problems. Every time. It’s always the foundation. I’m sick of it.

I recognize that I may just... not be able to wear foundation if this is the case without discomfort. Which sucks. But I’m just not SURE, and I don’t want to give up, but I don’t want to waste money on brands that will keep producing these results.

Makeup store employees consistently try to tell me I’m full of shit, sell me the things I said I’ve tried, and lo and behold it happens again every single time.

So is it an allergy or sensitivity? Should I give up? Do I just need to suck it up and play roulette until I find a brand, or just accept that discomfort is probably going to be consistent no matter what I do?

I’m sorry if this is a weird question, I just don’t know where else to go. Dermatologist was completely unhelpful. Thank you to anyone who reads or has any advice!",2021-01-06 04:12:48

Makeup,trouble with BB creams. (want to give up 😭),"I can’t find a SINGLE BB CREAM IN MY SHADE that is pale and cool-pink toned. 

It’s either too orange, grey, yellow or the formula isn’t good. I also feel like it’s making me look more oily sometimes. It’s getting difficult and I’m spending so so so much money trying to find something that isn’t working for me. 

for example I have have tried and didn’t like:
Missha #13, Nyx Skin veil, Pixi h20 skin tint (cream), Nars (the lightest shade), Bare Minerals Complexion Rescue (Opal), Covergirl CG smoothers (lightest shade), Maybelline BB cream (light), Tarte amazonian clay BB tinted moisturizer (lightest shade again I think Ivory) It cosmetics CC cream (lightest shade), Covergirl skin milk, and Colorpop Tinted Moisturizer (fair 1N) literally the only one I’ve really liked is Glossier skin tint in (G12) but that’s like non existent coverage lol

I don’t do my makeup that often anymore and I only really need light-medium coverage. I like looking more natural and don’t like the heavy feeling that foundation has. 

I’ve also tried only concealer too but it looks too patchy and dry :/ 

I feel stuck.

Makeup,Does anyone have any good products for uncontrollably flakey skin?,"I'm so tired of it. I wear makeup because I have bad acne and it makes me feel better, but it applies so... flakey and looks patchy and not even. It doesn't matter what lotion I use, face masks, primer, I constantly get flakey skin. 

The worst part is that I have to use setting powder, otherwise my foundation will shift badly throughout the day. But the setting powder enhances the dryness of my face.

It's especially bad on my nose. I like contouring my nose sometimes because it's fat as fuck and I need that shit to look snatched sometimes but the skin on my nose flakes SO hard. 

I've even vigorously washed and scrubbed my face(I know not ideal but I'm at my wit's end) but it's like, underneath those flakes of skin, is just more flakes of skin. I can't get rid of it.

Does anyone reccommend reasonably priced products that help with this? I have no idea if it's my foundation, or maybe the lotion, or if there's some product I should be using to help with this. Literally any suggestions will help me. Thank you in advance :)",2021-01-06 13:02:11

I did a little test run a few hours ago, using the included sponge applicator. No primer because I wanna see how it does on its own. The color match is spot-on (a rarity for my super-cool medium-light complexion) so that's good. I realized, though, I don't have a metric to judge this by.

- What are some things to look out for when gettng make up? Eg. Consistency, colour application etc. Personally I prefer a really low key, kind of soft vibe, but I dont know if that changes anything.

I tend to struggle with finding the best heavier shade. For instance, the Maybelline 02 Fair Beige Dream Radient Liquid is a tad too light (it dries up super fast on my skin too) and looks a bit too yellow/pale as it doesn't blend into my skin however, it's wearable in public. 

I was thinking of getting Seashell, as I like the pinker foundation as it seems to compliment my skin more (like the UD 0.5) but I'm afraid a full coverage foundation will make me look super pink. I was initially going to go for snow however on youtube videos, it seems quite pale. I'm also considering getting Pearl too but I feel it may be a tad too yellow. Same with Almond. I'd go get colour matched but as we're in a lockdown (England) it's difficult to get hold of one and the nearest place that does do colour matches is a few hours away.

Any suggestions? Thanks for any help!",2020-12-01 21:25:54

Makeup,Makeup tips for a man?,"Hi there,

As a teenager I had dreadful acne, to the extent that there are very few photos of me between the ages of thirteen and seventeen. 

I’m now 23 and still pretty self conscious whenever I get spots. I also like the idea of putting a little bit of extra effort in when I’m in the mood.

Perhaps it’s me being excessively macho but I would be pretty mortified if anyone (except for a few friends) figured out that I was wearing make up.

Do you have any tips for a newbie. I thought about getting a concealer but am mixed race so am not sure about the skin tone. I’m not yet ready to try make up on in a shop so don’t know how I could find out what shade is right for me.",2020-12-02 00:38:05

Makeup,Favorite lipstick formula and why? bullet? mega matte? liquid lip? gloss?,"Just curious what type of lip products people favor in this community. I personally really enjoy the liquid lips that don't dry all the way down into the stay-on-forever types, like the old Bite Beauty Amuse Bouche liquefied lip ones, and i have a set of Smashbox ones that I like a lot. I think they wear nicely, but my only complaint is they do get on my teeth sometimes and I have to be very vigilante about that when I first put them on. No idea how they travel so much, but I usually wear them as more of a stain so it's not a huge deal. 

Second is bullet lipsticks, but some brands leave a sort of film on my inner lips after wearing them for a long time and I am not sure what that is about. Again I liked Bite's bullets before reformulation (I'm not talking shit- I just haven't tried their new ones yet), along with Urban Decay Vice, Bare Minerals and Tarte. 

I love holiday mini sets because it's so rare I ever get to the end of any products except the basics like mascara, so minis are my jam because I get to try them out without dropping $20 per lippie if I don't like it.",2020-12-02 22:44:03

Makeup,Makeup Recommendations for Pre-Teen?,"My fiance and I got to talking and decided that his daughter is old enough now and has shown herself to be responsible enough that we want to get her real make-up to play with now. Makeup is something she's expressed interest in, and she's asked to wear mine before. I've told her no, and explained why, but said that if she can show to all of us (Mom, Dad, Step-dad, and me) that she's responsible enough for this kind of privilege, we'd consider getting some for her.

She won't be wearing it out of the house or anything, and I'll be using this as an opportunity for her and me to spend some more time together and to kinds open that door for her and me to have a really good relationship moving forward into her teen years. (Our relationship is fine now, btw, I've known her since she was 6, I just know it's going to change as she changes and grows)

I'm looking for help finding a few brands that are on the cheaper side, since this will basically be play makeup, but are still a decent quality to not utterly ruin her skin. I do wear makeup pretty regularly, but I have a skin disease and have only ever had good reactions to more expensive brands, and I don't think we're quite ready for that.

For those wondering, she recently turned 10. I can understand how some see that as really young to start letting her wear makeup, but I'm gonna treat it as more of a dress-up thing right now. Again, she won't wear it out of the house, except maybe to the drive-thru for chicken nuggets.

I know it's been a couple years since the discontinuation of this foundation, but I started using the Maybelline air foam foundation since 2013 and fell in love! Even though it oxidizes, which I know is not favorable in the makeup community, for me, it turns really radiant and a dewy finish on me. Even after trying several other foundations now, I've learned this one really gives me a beautiful sheer airbrush like finish effect, and just really works with my skin color/blush/bronzer combo, and with my skin texture!

I have dry, acne prone skin, textured (sheer with buildable coverage, with dewy radiant finish really works for me here), with yellow/golden undertones (natural beige shade in maybelline if that helps). (something that doesn't clog the skin too much preferred as well, but desperate to try anything!)

I know I can still buy it on ebay/amazon and the likes, but I'm preparing for when those aren't an option anymore! Does anybody have any good dupes for this?

A side benefit of the bracket is it keeps your lip makeup intact -- I was sad because I couldn't wear colored lip products since it would smear onto my mask, but now the bracket separates your lips from the mask and prevents smudging.

Makeup,Rediscovered my love of powder foundation,"I live in NZ and we've just entered our summer season (yay!). As the weather has been warming up I've been struggling with my usual liquid foundations looking shiny and shitty by the end of the day; forehead shine, rubbing off everywhere, patchy and separating...yum (/s). No matter which one I tried, the same thing was happening. 

I was decluttering my second tier makeup drawer and saw a Chanel powder that I got ages ago and on a whim decided to try it out today instead of liquid and .... oh my. Let me tell you, my skin today has looked perfect. Absolutely perfect. All. Day. Long. Completely natural, no horrible forehead shine, no patchiness, just even complexion with a lovely satin like finish. I'm so happy. I had completely forgotten about how good powder foundation can be. I also used a Nars powder blush ontop and it looked amazing; I've struggled using it with liquid foundation before (for obvious reasons) but ontop of the powder is just perfect. So now I've demoted all my liquids to the second tier drawer and am all about powder this season!

So I have combination skin, with my T-zone especially getting oily, and I've been looking for a very good spray, I especially have been looking at Mac Fix+ Matte (fixing spray) and Urban Decay All Nighter (setting spray), but I am still undecided and am still looking for that HG spray. 

For reference I also use High-Adherence Silicone Primer from The Ordinary and Mac Studio Fix SPF 15 and MAC Transparent Powder and use a really awful fixing spray that I bought from this unknown, no-name brand and it's a decision I really regret, cause it does nothing and only contains fragrance.

Makeup,Make Up table ideas,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I want to surprise my SO with a make up table for Christmas and I since I don't know anything about make-upping(?) I hope I can find some guidance here. 

&amp;#x200B;

This will be the table: [https://www.ikea.com/my/en/p/micke-desk-black-brown-60354277/](https://www.ikea.com/my/en/p/micke-desk-black-brown-60354277/) but after that I'm a bit lost.

Is this a good mirror, light and size wise?

Makeup,Can we let women who want to wear makeup just be and let those who don’t just be without making a big humble bragging deal of how you “never wear makeup.” Here’s why.,"For many women makeup is an artistic expression and it’s also therapeutic, it may be the only 15 mins a mother has to herself in a day. I don’t think women need to wear makeup like they’re going on a photo shoot each day but if she’s more confident with some foundation etc, then there’s nothing wrong with it. Why do we shower and wash our hair, it makes us feel good. I’ve always had skin breakouts since my teens and I’m 33 and still do. It sucks because I’ve tried everything but still have to cover up skin tone damage. I do this because it makes me feel better to not have discolored skin visible to everybody. I’m also treated better by society by looking my best. It’s my routine just like applying moisturizer or keeping my hair nice and healthy. Nothing more annoying than beautiful skinned people who have never had a pimple brag how they “don’t wear makeup.” Good job. But please have some consideration for how you make women feel who do chronic have skin issues, and all we want is to not have them. It’s nothing to do with not having self esteem, I have plenty because I accept my flaws and imperfections and like anyone I do make the best of my situation by using quality makeup and a good skin care routine. I still get breakouts, and I can’t just put random junk on my face like other people who never have a reaction to anything. Rest assured if you ever had a patch of 5-6 pimples on your chin every month you would be covering them up too. Just because your skin genetics are better doesn’t give you the right to humble brag about “never wearing makeup” and indirectly shaming women who do. I’ve met women in their 30s with really bad acne and I see how it makes them feel. They wish they didn’t have that problem. But no they are not going to “be brave” and bare their flawless natural skin without blush because that’s not their reality. It’s sad and no one should be experiencing that in their 30s. So for women who love to brag about not wearing makeup, just put yourself in someone else’s shoes and shut up for once. You’re not better or more confident just because you have an even skin tone and others don’t. It is conceited if anything, for failing to support other women in their effort to put their best foot forward, even if that includes a makeup routine. Thanks.",2020-12-04 23:48:29

Makeup,Anyone know whatever happened to Permabrow and LipTechs products from the 90s?,"Do you guys remember these products? They were sold in beauty supply stores as PermaBrow and Lip Techs. They were sold as two different products,  one for your lips the other for your brows, but could be used interchangeably. They came in a tube, with a nailpolish type soft brush inside. The liquid inside was clear. The point of these products was to brush the product on top of your freshly applied lips or eyebrows, let it dry for a minute or two, and your eyebrows or lipstick ( regardless of color, brand or how cheap the makeup you applied was), would stay on for 24 hours, even if you went swimming. These products were amazing,  they truly worked and were waterproof. Your lipstick or eyebrows WOULD NOT COME OFF in the water. The only thing that would take it off after applying Lip Techs or Permabrow was scrubbing with soap and water. As these products could he used interchangeably, I found the Liptechs to be slightly better than Permabrow, but both were awesome.

Does anyone know what happened to them? I'm pretty sure they went out of business.  Google searching returns nothing,  although I might be spelling them a bit differently. It's been years since I've used these, so it's hard to remember the correct spelling.
But more importantly,  if they are out of business,  where can I find a clear, brush on over makeup product just like this for lips and eyebrows that is also awesome?

I dont want something to put on **under** the lipstick  but I need something that won't break it down (act as a solvent) on top because it just looks too parched.

It's the only lipstick I use (don't want to switch brands) because it is so pigmented  and I have two unusual colors I live in.  I just need something to put on top so it doesn't look so crazy dry.

One reason I wear it is it doesn't seep into the fine lines around my mouth so I do not want anything with solvent properties for this product.

Makeup,Why do all blushes pull warm on me?,"Maybe this is an inane question, but I'm curious. FYI, I am fair with olive undertones. I think I lie somewhere between neutral and yellow.

I've recently noticed that all my blushes pull warm on me. While I generally prefer peachy and brown-ish shades (Luminoso from Milani and the old formulation of Rose Champagne from Wet n' Wild are favorites), I've noticed that cooler blushes also blend into a peachy-warm shade on me. Plum Rose from Physician's Formula, Paaarty from Tarte, and Dolce Pink from Milani all do this. 

This isn't due to dirty brushes, and I'm not sure if it's due to my undertones. Cool-toned eyeshadows, highlighters, and lipsticks all stay true-to-color on me, but blushes do not. I was wondering if anyone had any insight; I'm a little sick of peachy cheeks no matter which blush I wear.",2020-12-06 14:40:43

I have also tried a neutral foundations and that looks ""frosty"" and a little purple-ish on my neck, but my sister said she thinks it ""ties in my face and neck together"". I'm pretty sure I'm not olive since, from what I understand olive skin tones tend to have a green or more ashy appearance to their skin, which I don't have.

Most of the time outdoors (pre-covid) I just wear a lip tint and eyebrow pencil. And that is it. Of course I have mascara, foundation, eyeliner (liquid), concealer, highlighter, and all the other make up stuff but honestly I just hoard them and never got to put them on use because I just don’t know how to put them on properly.

Also, people who can draw perfect winged eyeliners amaze me. Like girl, how did you do that?

I'm going to be undergoing chemotherapy soon, and will likely lose all of my hair. Tbh I'm not that upset about the hair loss - I actually think it's an opportunity to do some really cool looks - but I need some makeup that will not budge. 

What's the best eyebrow pencil/gel/pomade that can get a natural look and not slide off my face? I have pretty oily skin (that could change during chemo, but idk). I'm a redhead, so I'm not very experienced with heavy eyebrow makeup. 

As for lashes, will falsies even stick if I don't have real eyelashes to help hold them up? Are there any great glue options for that? 

Also I know you can't really give advice about my specific skin tone, but what's a makeup brand that's well-known for accurate color matching? I use MAC studio powder now, and it's not exactly right. I want to be able to wear makeup without having to put it all over my head.

The packaging has all the seed indentations, the gold is right. It feels right. It also SMELLS a bit melony.  A bit like the cucumber face mist smell and it's pretty strong. The only problem is the serial numbers, which can be a big give away. On the box it says A89 and on both slices of the palette it says B69 which is weird. Any ideas? If it's fake I'm not disappointed. I didn't spend a lot and it is what it is.",2020-12-08 18:46:00

I've been looking on the Clinique website and they have the Dramatically Different lipstick in Tenderheart.

When they sent it again I got an email with a tracking link, after the link still wasn't working after a week I contacted Sigma asking if something was wrong again. No they said, there is no tracking available on the shipment method they chose to send it with. Ok, so how long until the order will arrive, keeping in mind I've waited since August already, well it's 2-3 month from now, then it will ""likely"" arrive!

I've been lusting after the pillow talk quad but have held back because of the price, so I was wondering if the Divine Skies palette was similar.

And now I’d prefer a less pigmented blush. 

I’m looking for something without shimmer, not too pigmented, not too expensive, and long wearing. I’m fair/light with yellow undertones. Shades with too much brown look terrible on me and I like a shade that goes with almost anything if that makes sense. For reference, my previous favorite was thebalm frat boy; I still like it but it’s just too intense!

Makeup,Tips and tricks for those with dry skin/eyelids,"I have eczema and I struggle badly on my face. Because I constantly monitor it, it's never too bad, but sometimes I can't prevent dryness and that's usually on my eyelids. They're often red, irritated and hurt. They also make me super sleepy because it hurts to keep them open. In the meantime, I've just applied moisturiser twice a day but that usually doesn't help. They always stay bad. There's been times where I've taken a full face of make up of because my eyelids were too dry for eyeshadow. I had given up.

That was until today. My sister and I went into Tkmaxx to have a look around and we walked over to the skincare aisle as my sister is super interested in it. I've never liked skincare because having eczema, 9 times out of 10 it ends up making my skin worse. However, today I found myself drawn to the [Tonymoly Kitty Eye Contour Stick](https://tonymoly.us/products/cats-purrfect-eye-contour-stick) and the [Tonymoly Whale Eye Cream](https://tonymoly.us/products/moisture-boost-cooling-eye-serum). I heard of a website recently called [Skin Sort](https://skinsort.com/ingredient-analyzer) which have an analyser to tell you if a certain product would help your skin or not. I tried it on the products in the shop and the whale seemed really good. The cat one wasn't good for eczema but for some reason I thought screw it and went for it. 

I'm so glad I did. My eyelids are so soft and gentle. They feel nice. Silky smooth, but not sticky and they've been like this for hours now. They're the best purchase I've ever made.

My tips and tricks are:
- Use Skin Sort!  It tells you if it's best for your skin or not and can give you an estimate of of it's worth it.
- If you suffer from dry eyelids like me, please try this. I hope it does the same for you. Admittedly, my eyes burned a tiny bit when I put the eye cream on, but it instantly stopped and hasn't burned since (my eyelids were just irritated).",2020-12-10 12:06:36

So my problem is the following. I used to do makeup every day for years, but then about 1.5 years ago stopped completely.

Im trying to get back into it, past couple of weeks I've done eye makeup 5 times. BUT after an hour or so after applying product my eyes start getting irritated, and after about 3 hours they are bloodshot and get discharge (puss or something, idk).

All products are completely new with good exp date, and I used different ones each time to eliminate allergy possibility.

Few years back I stopped doing makeup for a year, and when I started again I had a little irritation for a couple of days, but I NEVER had a reaction to this extent before.

All articles I found go on about red eyes being caused by allergy to a particular product, or fallout from eyeshadow, but I have used eyeshadow yet and my reaction of caused by *all* products.
